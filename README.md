# Bibliography

This repository hosts the BibTeX library for my research and publications. It is automatically synchronized with my Zotero library to ensure the latest citations are always available for LaTeX and Markdown workflows.

## Contents

* `references.bib`: The primary BibTeX file containing all top-level items from the Zotero library.

## Automation Details

This repository is **auto-generated**. Manual changes to the `.bib` file should be avoided as they will be overwritten during the next synchronization cycle.

- **Source:** [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/)
- **Sync Frequency:** Daily via Cron Job 
- **Generator:** Zotero Web API (BibTeX Export)

## Usage

### Linking to LaTeX/Overleaf
You can pull this bibliography directly into your LaTeX projects using the raw GitHub URL:
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jcpru/references/main/references.bib`

### Citations
All entries use the citation keys generated by Zotero. If you notice issues with key stability, ensure "Better BibTeX" is used for pinning keys in the source library.

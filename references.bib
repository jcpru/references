	abstract = {Despite their importance in many chemical processes, the relative energies of spin states of transition metal complexes have so far been haunted by large computational errors. By the use of six functionals, B3LYP, BP86, TPSS, TPSSh, M06, and M06L, this work studies nine complexes (seven with iron and two with cobalt) for which experimental enthalpies of spin crossover are available. It is shown that such enthalpies can be used as quantitative benchmarks of a functional’s ability to balance electron correlation in both the involved states. TPSSh achieves an unprecedented mean absolute error of ∼11 kJ/mol in spin transition energies, with the local functional M06L a distant second (25 kJ/mol). Other tested functionals give mean absolute errors of 40 kJ/mol or more. This work confirms earlier suggestions that 10\% exact exchange is near-optimal for describing the electron correlation effects of first-row transition metal systems. Furthermore, it is shown that given an experimental structure of an iron complex, TPSSh can predict the electronic state corresponding to that experimental structure. We recommend this functional as current state-of-the-art for studying spin crossover and relative energies of close-lying electronic configurations in first-row transition metal systems.},

	abstract = {Recent experiments have demonstrated that the electron transmission yield through chiral molecules depends on the electron spin orientation. This phenomenon has been termed the chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect, and it provides a challenge to theory and promise for organic molecule–based spintronic devices. This article reviews recent developments in our understanding of CISS. Different theoretical models have been used to describe the effect; however, they all presume an unusually large spin-orbit coupling in chiral molecules for the effect to display the magnitudes seen in experiments. A simplified model for an electron\&apos;s transport through a chiral potential suggests that these large couplings can be manifested. Techniques for measuring spin-selective electron transport through molecules are overviewed, and some examples of recent experiments are described. Finally, we present results obtained by studying several systems, and we describe the possible application of the CISS effect for memory devices.},

	abstract = {Carbon nanoribbons or nanographene qubit arrays can facilitate quantum-to-quantum transduction between light, charge, and spin, making them an excellent testbed for fundamental science in quantum coherent systems and for the construction of higher-level qubit circuits. In this work, we study spin decoherence due to coupling with a surrounding nuclear spin bath of an electronic molecular spin of a vanadyl phthalocyanine (VOPc) molecule integrated onto an armchair-edged graphene nanoribbon (GNR). Density functional theory (DFT) is used to obtain ground-state atomic configurations. Decay of spin coherence in Hahn echo experiments is then simulated using the cluster correlation expansion method with a spin Hamiltonian involving hyperfine and electric field gradient tensors calculated from DFT. We find that the decoherence time T2 is anisotropic with respect to magnetic field orientation and determined only by the hydrogen nuclear spins on both VOPc and GNR. Large electron spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) due to nitrogen and vanadium nuclear spins is present at specific field ranges and can be completely suppressed by tuning the magnetic field. The relation between these field ranges and the hyperfine interactions is analyzed. The effects of interactions with the nuclear quadrupole moments are also studied, validating the applicability and limitations of the spin Hamiltonian when they are disregarded.},

We also discussed the strategies to build hybrid spintronic devices by integrating organic molecules between two ferromagnetic electrodes in molecular spin valves. Magnetoresistance, resistive switching, and their coexistence can be used to build logic gates, neuromorphic devices, and memory devices. We described challenges and opportunities associated with integrating these materials into functional memory devices, focusing on key aspects such as interface engineering, spin conservation, and scalability.

For the optimization of these new complexes, a detailed understanding of the excited-state deactivation paths is necessary. Here, we report femtosecond transient mid-IR spectroscopy data on a recently developed octahedral ligand-field enhancing [Fe(dqp)2]2+ (C1) complex with dqp = 2,6-diquinolylpyridine and prototypical [Fe(bpy)3]2+ (C0). By combining mid-IR spectroscopy with quantum chemical DFT calculations, we propose a method for disentangling the 5Q1 and 3T1 multiplicities of the long-lived metal-centered (MC) states, applicable to a variety of metal–organic iron complexes. Our results for C0 align well with the established assignment toward the 5Q1, validating our approach. For C1, we find that deactivation of the initially excited metal-to-ligand charge-transfer state leads to a population of a long-lived MC 5Q1 state. Analysis of transient changes in the mid-IR shows an ultrafast sub 200 fs rearrangement of ligand geometry for both complexes, accompanying the MLCT → MC deactivation. This confirms that the flexibility in the ligand sphere supports the stabilization of high spin states and plays a crucial role in the MLCT lifetime of metal–organic iron complexes.},

	abstract = {Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides have emerged as prominent candidates to explore the complex interplay between spin and valley degrees of freedom. Their strong spin-orbit interaction and broken inversion symmetry lead to the spin-valley locking effect, in which carriers occupying the K and K′ valleys of the reciprocal space must have opposite spins. This effect is particularly strong for holes due to a larger spin-orbit gap in the valence band. By reducing the dimensionality of a monolayer of WSe2 to 1D via electrostatic confinement, we demonstrate that spin-valley locking and strong hole-hole interactions lead to a ferromagnetic state where hole transport is spin-valley polarized, even without an applied magnetic field. A massive Dirac fermion model in the Hartree-Fock approximation reveals that many-body hole-exchange interactions lead to this polarized ground-state. This observation opens the possibility of implementing a robust and stable valley-polarized system, essential in valleytronic applications.},

All devices exhibit NDR, with the potassium-based one exhibiting NDR at room temperature because of the larger charging and confinement energies. Our experimental results are reproduced with a simple model that assumes sequential electron tunnelling through two series-connected charge centres, each having two discrete energy levels. The model utilises the nonequilibrium Keldysh diagram technique, and its accuracy is improved by introducing an effective local temperature that depends on the dissipated power and by semi-classical averaging of fluctuations of the dopant spectra. Our control experiments on undoped devices revealed the bandgap boundaries of the silicon host matrix which we successfully modelled using a single-barrier approximation. The use of unconventional dopants in silicon with high characteristic energies, such as potassium, is a major step forward toward the implementation of room-temperature single-atom electronics.},

Precise photonic crystal engineering, as well as active all-optical control, enable the realization of effective magnetization textures beyond the limits of thermodynamic stability in current materials. As a proof-of-concept, we theoretically design skyrmionic nonlinear photonic crystals with arbitrary topologies and propose an optical system exhibiting the topological Hall effect.

	abstract = {Single-molecule spin-crossover (SCO) complexes have been considered to be the promising candidates to design molecular spintronic devices due to their magnetic bistability between the high-spin (HS) and low-spin (LS) states. By performing extensive density functional theory calculations in combination with the nonequilibrium Green function method, we explore the SCO and coherent transport behaviors of a six-coordinate Fe(II) complex with a N4O2 donor set. The calculated relative total electronic energies imply that the spin transition between the HS and LS states can be achieved by external stimuli in experiments via changing the metal–ligand bond lengths. Based on the calculated transport results, we find that the current through the six-coordinate Fe(II) complex with the LS state sandwiched between gold electrodes is significantly less than that of the HS state due to their significantly different electronic structures. Moreover, the molecular junction with the HS state displays a robust spin-filtering effect, and the current under the small bias voltage is dominated by the spin-down electrons. Interestingly, we observe that the transport properties of this examined Fe(II) complex with the HS and LS states are not sensitive to the detailed anchoring configuration, which is highly desirable in molecular spintronics. These theoretical findings suggest this Fe(II) SCO complex holds great potential in molecular spintronic devices.},

Due to the non-conservation of particle number, the method does not seem to be suited for the calculation of the ground state energy, but it gives good results for ionisation potentials. The investigation reveals that the only partitioning which conserves the number of particles is the Hartree-Fock partitioning (b) the renormalisedΣ perturbation method, suggested by Csnak and others.

It is based on a mixing of standard generalized gradient approximations (GGAs) for exchange by Becke (B) and for correlation by Lee, Yang, and Parr (LYP) with Hartree-Fock (HF) exchange and a perturbative second-order correlation part (PT2) that is obtained from the Kohn-Sham (GGA) orbitals and eigenvalues. This virtual orbital-dependent functional contains only two global parameters that describe the mixture of HF and GGA exchange (ax) and of the PT2 and GGA correlation (c), respectively. The parameters are obtained in a least-squares-fit procedure to the G2∕97 set of heat of formations. Opposed to conventional hybrid functionals, the optimum ax is found to be quite large (53\% with c=27\%) which at least in part explains the success for many problematic molecular systems compared to conventional approaches. The performance of the new functional termed B2-PLYP is assessed by the G2∕97 standard benchmark set, a second test suite of atoms, molecules, and reactions that are considered as electronically very difficult (including transition-metal compounds, weakly bonded complexes, and reaction barriers) and comparisons with other hybrid functionals of GGA and meta-GGA types. According to many realistic tests, B2-PLYP can be regarded as the best general purpose density functional for molecules (e.g., a mean absolute deviation for the two test sets of only 1.8 and 3.2kcal∕mol compared to about 3 and 5kcal∕mol, respectively, for the best other density functionals). Very importantly, also the maximum and minium errors (outliers) are strongly reduced (by about 10–20kcal∕mol). Furthermore, very good results are obtained for transition state barriers but unlike previous attempts at such a good description, this definitely comes not at the expense of equilibrium properties. Preliminary calculations of the equilibrium bond lengths and harmonic vibrational frequencies for diatomic molecules and transition-metal complexes also show very promising results. The uniformity with which B2-PLYP improves for a wide range of chemical systems emphasizes the need of (virtual) orbital-dependent terms that describe nonlocal electron correlation in accurate exchange-correlation functionals. From a practical point of view, the new functional seems to be very robust and it is thus suggested as an efficient quantum chemical method of general purpose.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}We review the GPAW open-source Python package for electronic structure calculations. GPAW is based on the projector-augmented wave method and can solve the self-consistent density functional theory (DFT) equations using three different wave-function representations, namely real-space grids, plane waves, and numerical atomic orbitals. The three representations are complementary and mutually independent and can be connected by transformations via the real-space grid. This multi-basis feature renders GPAW highly versatile and unique among similar codes. By virtue of its modular structure, the GPAW code constitutes an ideal platform for the implementation of new features and methodologies. Moreover, it is well integrated with the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE), providing a flexible and dynamic user interface. In addition to ground-state DFT calculations, GPAW supports many-body GW band structures, optical excitations from the Bethe–Salpeter Equation, variational calculations of excited states in molecules and solids via direct optimization, and real-time propagation of the Kohn–Sham equations within time-dependent DFT. A range of more advanced methods to describe magnetic excitations and non-collinear magnetism in solids are also now available. In addition, GPAW can calculate non-linear optical tensors of solids, charged crystal point defects, and much more. Recently, support for graphics processing unit (GPU) acceleration has been achieved with minor modifications to the GPAW code thanks to the CuPy library. We end the review with an outlook, describing some future plans for GPAW.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Using first-principles calculations combined with the non-equilibrium Green's function technique, we explored the spin-resolved electronic and transport properties of photochromic Fe(II) SCO complexes in the high-spin state with the open-ring (HS-O) isomer and in the low-spin state with the closed-ring (LS-C) isomer, since the photocyclization and photocycloreversion between the HS-O and LS-C isomers can be reversibly realized under light radiation with different wavelengths at room temperature as in previous experiments. Our results clearly reveal that the examined Fe(II) SCO complexes with photochromic diarylethene-based ligands in the HS-O isomer have lower energy than the LS-C isomer of 0.59 eV. A nearly perfect spin-filtering effect is observed in the proposed molecular junction in the HS-O isomer, in which the Fe(II) SCO complexes are sandwiched between two Au(111) electrodes. The current is carried predominantly by the spin-down electrons within the considered bias voltages, while the spin-up electrons are largely inhibited due to localized molecular orbitals near the Fermi level. At the same time, we also observed an obvious current-switching effect between the HS-O and LS-C isomers, since the current through the molecular devices in the HS-O isomer (acting as the ON state) is significantly larger than that in the LS-C isomer (OFF state). These findings highlight the great potential of this kind of photo-driven SCO complex in future molecular spintronics.},

	abstract = {Molecule-based spin crossover (SCO) materials display likely one of the most spectacular switchable processes. The SCO involves reversible changes in their physicochemical properties (i.e. optical, magnetic, electronic, and elastic) that are coupled with the spin-state change under an external perturbation (i.e. temperature, light, magnetic field, or the inclusion/release of analytes). Although very promising for their future integration into electronic devices, most SCO compounds show two major drawbacks: (i) their intrinsic low conductance and (ii) the unclear mechanism connecting the spin-state change and the electrical conductivity. Herein, we report the controlled single-crystal-to-single-crystal temperature-induced transformation in a robust metal–organic framework, [Fe2(H0.67bdt)3]·9H2O (1), being bdt2– = 1,4-benzeneditetrazolate, exhibiting a dynamic spin-state change concomitant with an increment in the anisotropic electrical conductance. Compound 1 remains intact during the SCO process even after approximately a 15\% volume reduction. The experimental findings are rationalized by analyzing the electronic delocalization of the frontier states by means of density-functional theory calculations. The results point to a correlation between the spin-state of the iron and the electronic conductivity of the 3D structure. In addition, the reversibility of the process is proved.},

              We study coherent spin transport through helical edge states of topological insulator tunnel-coupled to metallic leads. We demonstrate that unpolarized incoming electron beam acquires finite polarization after transmission through such a setup provided that edges contain at least one magnetic impurity. The finite polarization appears even in the fully classical regime and is therefore robust to dephasing. There is also a quantum magnetic field-tunable contribution to the polarization, which shows sharp identical Aharonov-Bohm resonances as a function of magnetic flux—with the period

We demonstrate that this tunneling interferometer can be described in terms of ensemble of flux-tunable qubits giving equal contributions to conductance and spin polarization. The number of active qubits participating in the charge and spin transport is given by the ratio of the temperature and the level spacing. The interferometer can effectively operate at high temperature and can be used for quantum calculations. In particular, the ensemble of qubits can be described by a single Hadamard operator. The obtained results open wide avenue for applications in the area of quantum computing.},

This approach is demonstrated for transition metal oxides, europium chalcogenides, and narrow-gap semiconductors.

Prior research has been done on the performance of lithium storage in SnFe2O4. However, the electrochemical processes that take place during the lithiation-delithiation cycle of LIBs have not been explained in depth yet. In order to understand the discharge mechanism in the LixSnFe2O4 anode (x = 0 to 2), we systematically investigated its electrochemical characteristics, structural and electronic properties, average formation energies, open-circuit voltages, diffusion coefficient, and volume expansion using density functional theory. According to our calculations, an increase in Li concentration x up to 1.125 leads to enhanced stability of the LixSnFe2O4 systems. During this process, Li+ ions prefer to be intercalated at the octahedral 16c sites, inducing the displacement of Sn2+ ions from tetrahedral sites 8a to 16c and 48f sites. However, for 1.125 {\textless} x {\textless} 2, lithium ions tend to occupy the less stable sites 48f, which reduces the stability of LixSnFe2O4 systems. Additionally, the calculated lithium intercalation voltage for full lithiation Li1.125SnFe2O4 is equal to 1.5 V, and the distortion of the LixSnFe2O4 system occurs at a voltage of 0.75 V, which is in well agreement with experimental results. The Li-coefficient diffusion on SnFe2O4 at 300 K is calculated by ab initio molecular dynamic simulation and equal to 8.22 × 10−8 cm2/s, which indicates the excellent mobility of Li ions in SnFe2O4. Considering all these results, we can suggest SnFe2O4 as a promising negative electrode material for lithium-ion batteries.},

Due to its balance between accuracy and computational cost, local density approximation combined with Hubbard U model (LDA+U) is an appealing tool for this purpose. Despite its accurate performance on energetic properties, such as spin adiabatic energy difference, it is well-known that the LDA+U approach would lose its predictive power if U is tuned to achieve close agreement with experiment for a certain property. On the other hand, a static U value cannot account for changes in the electronic structure. Here, we propose a framework to derive dynamical U (Udyn) values for iron(ii) complexes from the many-body GW calculations. By performing model calculations on a series of compounds with varying ligand fields, we show that the U values determined in this way are local environment dependent, and the resulting LDA+Udyn method could reproduce their experimental ground spin states. We present applications to selected SCO complexes illustrating that Udyn considerably overcomes some of the drawbacks of employing a constant U in the calculation of thermochemical quantities.

A better understanding of how water molecules affect the band edge levels of MoS2 is critical for promoting the interfacial reactivity. Here, we determine the structures of water monolayers on MoS2 using global optimizations achieved by molecular dynamics in combination with local minimization. It is shown that cyclic water clusters are formed on a surface through a hydrogen-bonding network. The absolute band edge positions are explored taking into account the derivative discontinuity of the exchange–correlation functional. Shifts in band edges are observed with the increase in H2O coverage, while bandgaps tend to be slightly decreased. In particular, the band alignment relative to water redox potentials has been investigated in detail. We find that the dimer configuration is likely to suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), while the polygon clusters lift the conduction band by 0.2–0.7 eV, and thus, they would enhance HER. This effect is explained in terms of the linear dependence of the band edge offset on an interface electric dipole arising from water assemblies.},

	abstract = {2D gallium nitride possesses distinctive electronic states, making it ideal for future optoelectronic devices because of the quantum confinement and enhanced many-body interactions inherent in its atomically thin form. This study explores the impact of molecular doping with Fe(II)-porphyrin (FeP) on these characteristics using first-principle calculations. Contact of the magnetic center Fe with the nitrogen site causes a 17\% decrease in the energy barrier for the transition from intermediate spin (S = 1) to high spin (S = 2) state, highlighting the sensitivity of spin dynamics to doping sites. Molecular diffusion barriers increase by 9.6 kJ/mol upon spin transition, suggesting that the spin state influences molecular mobility within the material. Exploring spectral functions reveals that FeP doping introduces spin-dependent molecule levels within the bandgap, which may play a role in electron–hole separation and spin injection. In addition, we show that the molecule–substrate coupling lowers the exciton binding energy by 0.1 eV, with further reduction during spin transitions. This weakening is attributed to increased electron mobility, quantified by static polarizability. These results indicate that the molecular spin state can control electronic excitations within substrate materials, presenting a promising strategy for designing spintronic devices.},

	abstract = {Strong correlation, breaking symmetry, band topology, collective excitation, and quantum confinement represent important features of quantum materials. When quantum materials intersect with spintronics, these key features fundamentally enhance the performance of spin-dependent phenomena. In this review, we examine recent advancements in the material requirements for spintronics and investigate the role of quantum effects in enhancing the functionalization of these devices. Current-induced spin-orbit torques offer a versatile tool to manipulate and excite magnetic order, with decoupled read and write paths that excite various types of materials. One crucial aspect of a spintronic device is the transition of writing layers from traditional transport to quantum transport. The recording layer, on the other hand, employs two-dimensional magnetic materials to achieve the ultimate limit of single-layer magnetic storage. Additionally, the utilization of antiferromagnetic and altermagnetic materials makes them suitable for high-density memories with minimal inter-bit dipole interactions and fast writing speed. Exploiting these emerging quantum materials, in spintronic devices and exploring how quantum effects enhance device functionality show significant potential for spintronic applications in the future.},

Here, we report the impact of substrates on thermal SCO in Fe(phen)2(NCS)2 (phen = 1,10-phenanthroline) deposited on metallic surfaces and monolayer two-dimensional materials. By first-principles calculations, we show that temperature-driven SCO is preserved on both hexagonal boron nitride and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), while low-spin ground states are locked on metal surfaces, including Cu(111), Ag(111), and Au(111). On the contrary, the molecule in contact with graphene exhibits a high-spin ground state. We demonstrate that the spin transition temperature Tc depends critically on surface environments, and we correlate this effect with the modification of electronic structures and molecular vibrations upon adsorption. In particular, a sulfur vacancy in MoS2 considerably increases Tc. These findings open a way to nanoscale applications related to spin state bistability.},

Using Hubbard-U corrected density-functional theory to describe strong correlation effects and a non-self-consistent diagonalization method to treat spin-orbit coupling, we demonstrate that the field-induced spin reorientation transition occurs in the standing-up molecule in both high-spin (HS) and low-spin states, while the transition only occurs in the HS state for the flat-lying molecule. We propose plausible mechanisms in terms of charge polarization at the interface as well as modifications of the electronic states near the Fermi level EF. We show that the molecule largely preserves its arrangement of 3d orbitals in the standing configuration due to the “insulating layer” (bridging ligand), whereas direct contact of the Mn ion with the substrate in the lying configuration induces an orbital degeneracy around EF, thus preventing the electrical modulation of magnetic anisotropies.},

The method is based on density functional theory (DFT) and determines the self-consistent electronic structure of a nanostructure coupled to 3-dimensional electrodes with different electrochemical potentials, using a full atomistic description of both the electrodes and the nanostructure. We find qualitative differences with other more approximative theoretical approaches, although we confirm that the theoretical conductance for a perfectly contacted DTB molecule is several orders of magnitude higher than the value obtained in molecular break junction (MBJ) experiments. We discuss the formation of the molecular contact in the MBJ, and calculate the current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of DTB for geometries which do not include perfect thiolate bonds to one or both of the electrodes.},

	doi = {10.1039/D5QM00487J},
	abstract = {In single-molecule junctions, quantum interference (QI) effects manifest even at room temperature and can be explained by simple quantum circuit rules (QCR), and a rather intuitive magic ratio (MR), theory. These rules characterise how individual moieties contribute to the overall electrical conductance (G), of a molecule and how the overall G can change when the connectivities between different moieties is varied. Here we examine the electrical conductance of a single-ferrocene junction when the two metal electrodes connect to both upper and lower cyclopentadienyl (CP) rings and compare this with the conductance when both electrodes are contacted to only the upper CP ring. In the case of the former, the angle of rotation θ between the upper and lower rings could be changed by varying the distance between the electrodes. The main aim of our investigation is to determine how QI within the ferrocene core is affected by the length of linker groups, which connect the core to electrodes. We find that when θ = 0, short and long molecules exhibit destructive QI (DQI) features within the HOMO–LUMO gap, whereas as θ is increased, the DQI is alleviated. However, DQI within the HOMO–LUMO gap is alleviated at entirely different rotation angles of θ {\textgreater}20° for the molecule with longer linkers, compared to {\textgreater}60° for the shorter molecule. This shows that interference patterns within the ferrocene core are not simply a property of the core alone, but are a holistic property of the molecule as a whole. We investigated the Seebeck coefficients S of these molecules and found that S of the longer molecules can reach 250 μV K−1, which is significantly higher that the Seebeck coefficients of the shorter molecules.},

Our results suggest that appropriate molecular design may indeed allow us to construct highly sensitive molecular quantum rulers.},

Calculations have been carried out by density functional theory (DFT) and nonequilibrium Green’s function (NEGF) methods.

Good examples are graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), 1D conjugated polymers, and nanoporous graphenes (NPGs), which are gathering increasing attention for future carbon nanoelectronics. A key step is the ability to manipulate current flow within these nanomaterials. Destructive quantum interference (QI), long studied in the field of single-molecule electronics, has been proposed as the most effective way to achieve such control with molecular-scale precision. However, for practical applications, it is essential that such QI-engineering remains effective near or above room temperature. To assess this important point, here we combine large-scale molecular dynamics simulations and quantum transport calculations and focus our study on NPGs formed as arrays of laterally bonded GNRs. By considering various NPGs with different inter-GNR chemical connections we disentangle the different factors determining electronic transport in these carbon nanomaterials at 300 K. Our findings unequivocally demonstrate that QI survives at room temperature, with thermal vibrations weakly restricting current flow along GNRs while completely blocking transport across GNRs. Our results thus pave the way towards the future realization of QI-engineered carbon nanocircuitry operating at room temperature, which is a fundamental step towards carbon-based nanoelectronics and quantum technologies.},

	abstract = {We build on the concept of eigenvector continuation to develop an efficient multi-state method for the rigorous and smooth interpolation of a small training set of many-body wavefunctions through chemical space at mean-field cost. The inferred states are represented as variationally optimal linear combinations of the training states transferred between the many-body bases of different nuclear geometries. We show that analytic multi-state forces and nonadiabatic couplings from the model enable application to nonadiabatic molecular dynamics, developing an active learning scheme to ensure a compact and systematically improvable training set. This culminates in application to the nonadiabatic molecular dynamics of a photoexcited 28-atom hydrogen chain, with surprising complexity in the resulting nuclear motion. With just 22 DMRG calculations of training states from the low-energy correlated electronic structure at different geometries, we infer the multi-state energies, forces and nonadiabatic coupling vectors at 12 000 geometries with provable convergence to high accuracy along an ensemble of molecular trajectories, which would not be feasible with a brute force approach. This opens up a route to bridge the timescales between accurate single-point correlated electronic structure methods and timescales of relevance for photo-induced molecular dynamics.},

This article provides a survey of selected nonadiabatic methods based on quantum or classical trajectories. Among these techniques, trajectory surface hopping constitutes an interesting compromise between accuracy and efficiency for the simulation of medium- to large-scale molecular systems. This approach is, however, based on non-rigorous approximations that could compromise, in some cases, the correct description of the nonadiabatic effects under consideration and hamper a systematic improvement of the theory. With the help of an in principle exact description of nonadiabatic dynamics based on Bohmian quantum trajectories, we will investigate the origin of the main approximations in trajectory surface hopping and illustrate some of the limits of this approach by means of a few simple examples.},

	abstract = {We present a method to study rare nonadiabatic dynamics in open quantum systems using transition path sampling and quantum jump trajectories. As with applications of transition path sampling to classical dynamics, the method does not rely on prior knowledge of transition states or reactive pathways and thus can provide mechanistic insight into ultrafast relaxation processes in addition to their associated rates. In particular, we formulate a quantum path ensemble using the stochastic realizations of an unravelled quantum master equation, which results in trajectories that can be conditioned on starting and ending in particular quantum states. Because the dynamics rigorously obeys detailed balance, rate constants can be evaluated from reversible work calculations in this conditioned ensemble, allowing for branching ratios and yields to be computed in an unbiased manner. We illustrate the utility of this method with three examples: energy transfer in a donor-bridge-acceptor model, and models of photo-induced proton-coupled electron transfer and thermally activated electron transfer. These examples demonstrate the efficacy of path ensemble methods and pave the way for their use in studying complex reactive quantum dynamics.},

We find that the influence of the current itself on the bond-strength of carbon in general is remarkably low compared to e.g. typical metals. This is demonstrated for carbon chains, carbon nanotubes, graphene and polyacetylene. We can trace this to the strong binding and electronic bandstructure. On the other hand, we find that the current significantly change the magnetic properties. In particular, we find that currents in graphene zig-zag edge states quench the magnetism.},

	abstract = {Spin fluctuations in Fe(II)-porphyrins are at the heart of heme-proteins functionality. Despite significant progress in porphyrin chemistry, the mechanisms that rule spin state stabilization remain elusive. Here, it is demonstrated by using multiconfigurational quantum chemical approaches, including the novel Stochastic-CASSCF method, that electron delocalization between the metal center and the π system of the macrocycle differentially stabilizes the triplet spin states over the quintet. This delocalization takes place via charge-transfer excitations, involving the π system of the macrocycle and the out-of-plane iron d orbitals, key linking orbitals between metal and macrocycle. Through a correlated breathing mechanism the 3d electrons can make transitions toward the π orbitals of the macrocycle. This guarantees a strong coupling between the on-site radial correlation on the metal and electron delocalization. Opposite-spin 3d electrons of the triplet can effectively reduce electron repulsion in this manner. Constraining the out-of-plane orbitals from breathing hinders delocalization and reverses the spin ordering. The breathing mechanism is made effective by strong electron correlation effects in the π system of the macrocycle. Reducing the correlation treatment on the macrocycle to second-order only also reverses the spin ordering. High order (beyond second-order) correlation on the macrocycle reduces the energetic cost of the additional electron to a sufficient extent to stabilize the triplet state. Our results find a qualitative analogue in six resonance structures involving the metal center in the Fe2+ and Fe3+ oxidation states.},

In the transverse direction, it gives rise to a positive internal field with little temperature dependence up to 30 K.

The more accurate vdW-DF-optPBE and vdW-DF-optB88 functionals found the same binding site to be the most stable and yielded binding energies that were within ∼20\% of each other, whereas the binding energies computed with the vdW-DF-revPBE functional were substantially weaker. This work highlights the importance of vdW interactions for organometallic molecules chemisorbed to transition metal surfaces. The stability of the binding sites was found to depend upon the number of Fe–Pt and C–Pt bonds that were formed.

The results indicate that the electronic transport behavior is affected by the nature of molecule-electrode coupling, and the rectification ratio can be modulated by a proper choice of the anchoring groups. We reveal that the tetracene molecule when connected with isocyanide and amine combination exhibits remarkable rectifying performance (with a rectification ratio of 74) in contrast with other configurations. Furthermore, a prominent negative differential resistance (NDR) feature is observed when the molecule is connected with thiol as one of the anchors.

In this paper, we explored the spin-dependent electron transport properties of functional isomers namely benzyl alcohol and p-cresol.

The Density Functional Theory (DFT) with Non-Equilibrium Green’s Function (NEGF) was implemented to calculate Density of States (DOS), transmission spectrum, and   I–V characteristic of these molecular junctions in parallel and antiparallel configurations. The spin filter efficiency and magnetoresistance percentage were calculated using the current value at various bias ranges. From the spin filter efficiency, we found that the down-spin propagates in antiparallel configuration of both benzyl alcohol and p-cresol molecular junction.

	abstract = {Deep learning methods outperform human capabilities in pattern recognition and data processing problems and now have an increasingly important role in scientific discovery. A key application of machine learning in molecular science is to learn potential energy surfaces or force fields from ab initio solutions of the electronic Schrödinger equation using data sets obtained with density functional theory, coupled cluster or other quantum chemistry (QC) methods. In this Review, we discuss a complementary approach using machine learning to aid the direct solution of QC problems from first principles. Specifically, we focus on quantum Monte Carlo methods that use neural-network ansatzes to solve the electronic Schrödinger equation, in first and second quantization, computing ground and excited states and generalizing over multiple nuclear configurations. Although still at their infancy, these methods can already generate virtually exact solutions of the electronic Schrödinger equation for small systems and rival advanced conventional QC methods for systems with up to a few dozen electrons. Quantum Monte Carlo methods using neutral-network ansatzes can provide virtually exact solutions to the electronic Schrödinger equations for small systems and are comparable to conventional quantum chemistry methods when investigating systems with dozens of electrons.},

	abstract = {Over the last two decades, computational methods have made tremendous advances, and today many key properties of lithium-ion batteries can be accurately predicted by first principles calculations. For this reason, computations have become a cornerstone of battery-related research by providing insight into fundamental processes that are not otherwise accessible, such as ionic diffusion mechanisms and electronic structure effects, as well as a quantitative comparison with experimental results. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of state-of-the-art ab initio approaches for the modelling of battery materials. We consider techniques for the computation of equilibrium cell voltages, 0-Kelvin and finite-temperature voltage profiles, ionic mobility and thermal and electrolyte stability. The strengths and weaknesses of different electronic structure methods, such as DFT+U and hybrid functionals, are discussed in the context of voltage and phase diagram predictions, and we review the merits of lattice models for the evaluation of finite-temperature thermodynamics and kinetics. With such a complete set of methods at hand, first principles calculations of ordered, crystalline solids, i.e., of most electrode materials and solid electrolytes, have become reliable and quantitative. However, the description of molecular materials and disordered or amorphous phases remains an important challenge. We highlight recent exciting progress in this area, especially regarding the modelling of organic electrolytes and solid–electrolyte interfaces.},

	abstract = {Understanding the physical picture of Li ion transport in the current ionic conductors is quite essential to further develop lithium superionic conductors for solid-state batteries. The traditional practice of directly extrapolating room temperature ion diffusion properties from the high-temperature ({\textgreater}600 K) ab initio molecular dynamics simulations (AIMD) simulations by the Arrhenius assumption unavoidably cause some deviations. Fortunately, the ultralong-time molecular dynamics simulation based on the machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLMD) is a more suitable tool to probe into ion diffusion events at low temperatures and simultaneously keeps the accuracy at the density functional theory level. Herein, by the low-temperature MLMD simulations, the non-linear Arrhenius behavior of Li ion was found for Li3ErCl6, which is the main reason for the traditional AIMD simulation overestimating its ionic conductivity. The 1μs MLMD simulations capture polyanion rotation events in Li7P3S11 at room temperature, in which four [PS4]3− tetrahedra belonging to a part of the longer-chain [P2S7]4− group are noticed with remarkable rotational motions, while the isolated group [PS4]3− does not rotate. However, no polyanion rotation is observed in Li10GeP2S12, β-Li3PS4, Li3ErCl6, and Li3YBr6 at 300 K during 1μs simulation time. Additionally, the ultralong-time MLMD simulations demonstrate that not only there is no paddle-wheel effect in the crystalline Li7P3S11 at room temperature, but also the rotational [PS4]3− polyanion groups have weakly negative impacts on the overall Li ion diffusion. The ultralong-time MLMD simulations deepen our understanding of the relationship between the polyanion rotation and cation diffusion in ionic conductors at room environments.},

Although it is widely recognized that the crystalline structure of a cathode material largely dictates its electrochemical properties (e.g. capacity, cycle life and rate capabilities), this intrinsic connection in LiFePO4 has not been systematically reviewed. Different from the previous reviews, which mainly focus on the improvement of electrochemical performance by all kinds of techniques, in this review, the relationship between its electrochemical performance and bulk/surface structure is reviewed and discussed. First, it is revealed that the intra-particle Li+ transfer is influenced by several properties of the bulk, including crystalline structures, antisite defects and electronic structures. Next, it is demonstrated that the surface/interfacial structures of LiFePO4, which can be reconstructed artificially or spontaneously, also have great impacts on the performances. Lastly, the intrinsic connection between the structure and performance is preliminarily established, showing brand-new perspectives on the strategy for further improvement and contributing to a comprehensive understanding of LiFePO4.},

LiFePO4 is a relatively excellent material for lithium-ion batteries, which has many advantages of low cost, high capacity, and environmental friendliness. However, as a result of the low conductivity of lithium iron phosphate and the slow diffusion rate of lithium ion, the development of lithium iron phosphate in the power battery industry is restricted. As a power battery applied in real life, there is still a lot of research space in energy density, consistency, and low-temperature performance.

	abstract = {Chirality has been a property of central importance in physics, chemistry and biology for more than a century. Recently, electrons were found to become spin polarized after transmitting through chiral molecules, crystals, and their hybrids. This phenomenon, called chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS), presents broad application potentials and far-reaching fundamental implications involving intricate interplays among structural chirality, topological states, and electronic spin and orbitals. However, the microscopic picture of how chiral geometry influences electronic spin remains elusive, given the negligible spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in organic molecules. In this work, we address this issue via a direct comparison of magnetoconductance (MC) measurements on magnetic semiconductor-based chiral molecular spin valves with normal metal electrodes of contrasting SOC strengths. The experiment reveals that a heavy-metal electrode provides SOC to convert the orbital polarization induced by the chiral molecular structure to spin polarization. Our results illustrate the essential role of SOC in the metal electrode for the CISS spin valve effect. A tunneling model with a magnetochiral modulation of the potential barrier is shown to quantitatively account for the unusual transport behavior.},

A single electron spin forms a qubit and is suitable for quantum applications. In digital applications, the spin promises to offer an additional functionality to charge-based CMOS circuitry. Recently, spin injection into a semiconductor and spin manipulation by the gate voltage were successfully demonstrated providing a vision that devices using spin in addition to charge may appear in significant numbers on the market in the non-distant future. On the memory side, the nonvolatile CMOS-compatible spin-transfer torque (STT) and the spin–orbit torque (SOT) magnetoresistive random access memories (MRAMs) are already competing with flash memory and SRAM for embedded applications. A combination of nonvolatile elements with CMOS circuitry allows to shift the data processing into the nonvolatile segment, paving the way for a novel low power computational paradigm based on logic-in-memory and in-memory computing architectures. To model MRAM, we innovatively extend the spin and charge transport equations to multi-layered structures consisting of normal and ferromagnetic metal layers separated by tunnel barriers.

Following by a description of the most relevant transduction mechanisms of 2D materials employed for sensing. This review explores their advancement and implementation in sensing during the last decade in several areas, such as physical, chemical, bio and wearable sensors. Different types of 2D materials, including graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), 2D carbides and nitrides of transition metals (MXenes) and black phosphorus (BP), are considered.},

These scaling and memory reductions greatly increase the number of orbitals that can practically be included in AFQMC calculations, increasing the accuracy. Advances in real space methods include techniques for accurate computation of bandgaps and for systematically improving the nodal surface of ground state wavefunctions. Results of these calculations can be used to validate application of more approximate electronic structure methods, including GW and density functional based techniques. To provide an improved foundation for these calculations, we utilize a new set of correlation-consistent effective core potentials (pseudopotentials) that are more accurate than previous sets; these can also be applied in quantum-chemical and other many-body applications, not only QMC. These advances increase the efficiency, accuracy, and range of properties that can be studied in both molecules and materials with QMC and QMCPACK.},

	abstract = {This article reviews efforts to control and monitor the magnetization in antiferromagnetic materials, as well as the prospects for antiferromagnetic spintronics applications. Antiferromagnetic materials are internally magnetic, but the direction of their ordered microscopic moments alternates between individual atomic sites. The resulting zero net magnetic moment makes magnetism in antiferromagnets externally invisible. This implies that information stored in antiferromagnetic moments would be invisible to common magnetic probes, insensitive to disturbing magnetic fields, and the antiferromagnetic element would not magnetically affect its neighbours, regardless of how densely the elements are arranged in the device. The intrinsic high frequencies of antiferromagnetic dynamics represent another property that makes antiferromagnets distinct from ferromagnets. Among the outstanding questions is how to manipulate and detect the magnetic state of an antiferromagnet efficiently. In this Review we focus on recent works that have addressed this question. The field of antiferromagnetic spintronics can also be viewed from the general perspectives of spin transport, magnetic textures and dynamics, and materials research. We briefly mention this broader context, together with an outlook of future research and applications of antiferromagnetic spintronics.},

	abstract = {Low cost, scalability, potentially high energy density, and sustainability make organic magnesium (ion) battery (OMB) technologies a promising alternative to other rechargeable metal-ion battery solutions such as secondary lithium ion batteries (LIB). However, most reported OMB cathode materials have limited performance due to, in particular, low voltages often smaller than 2 V vs. Mg$^{\textrm{2+}}$/Mg and/or low specific capacities compared to other competing battery technologies, e.g., LIB or sodium ion batteries. While the structural diversity of organic compounds and the large amount of possible chemical modifications potentially allow designing high voltage/capacity OMB electrode materials, the large search space requires efficient exploration of potential molecular-based electrode materials by rational design strategies on an atomistic scale. By means of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we provide insights into possible strategies to increase the voltage by changes in electronic states via functionalization, by strain, and by coordination environment of Mg cations. A systematic analysis of these effects is performed on explanatory systems derived from selected prototypical building blocks: five- and six-membered rings with redox-active groups. We demonstrate that voltage increase by direct bandstructure modulation is limited, that strain on the molecular scale can in principle be used to modulate the voltage curve and that the coordination/chemical environment can play an important role to increase the voltage in OMB. We propose molecular structures that could provide voltages for Mg insertion in excess of 3 V.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Although high-entropy materials are attracting considerable interest due to a combination of useful properties and promising applications, predicting their formation remains a hindrance for rational discovery of new systems. Experimental approaches are based on physical intuition and/or expensive trial and error strategies. Most computational methods rely on the availability of sufficient experimental data and computational power. Machine learning (ML) applied to materials science can accelerate development and reduce costs. In this study, we propose an ML method, leveraging thermodynamic and compositional attributes of a given material for predicting the synthesizability (i.e., entropy-forming ability) of disordered metal carbides. The relative importance of the thermodynamic and compositional features for the predictions are then explored. The approach’s suitability is demonstrated by comparing values calculated with density functional theory to ML predictions. Finally, the model is employed to predict the entropy-forming ability of 70 new compositions; several predictions are validated by additional density functional theory calculations and experimental synthesis, corroborating the effectiveness in exploring vast compositional spaces in a high-throughput manner. Importantly, seven compositions are selected specifically, because they contain all three of the Group VI elements (Cr, Mo, and W), which do not form room temperature-stable rock-salt monocarbides. Incorporating the Group VI elements into the rock-salt structure provides further opportunity for tuning the electronic structure and potentially material performance.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This results in the direct detection of the spin polarization of conductivity (up to 14\%) and a spin-dependent Seebeck effect in the magnetic graphene. The efficient electrical and thermal spin–current generation is the most technologically relevant aspect of magnetism in graphene, controlled here by the antiferromagnetic dynamics of CrSBr. The high sensitivity of spin transport in graphene to the magnetization of the outermost layer of the adjacent antiferromagnet, furthermore, enables the read-out of a single magnetic sublattice.

In addition, a total magnetic moment can be induced in the 2D g-GaN by hydrogen adsorption due to s-p interaction and band structure effects. Although hydrogen adsorption on top of nitrogen atoms shows the most stable energy in the 2D g-GaN, the most stable ferromagnetism -with a nonzero magnetic moment-is obtained when hydrogen is adsorbed on top of Ga atoms. These results indicate that H adatoms on the 2D g-GaN systems could be a potential candidate for future spintronic applications.},

	abstract = {Two-dimensional gallium nitride (2D-GaN) has great potential in power electronics and optoelectronics. Heat dissipation is a critical issue for these applications of 2D-GaN. Previous studies have shown that higher-order phonon–phonon scattering has extremely strong effects on the lattice thermal conductivity ( κlat) of 2D-GaN, with the fourth-order interatomic force constants (4th-IFCs) calculated using experienced atomic displacement in the finite difference method. In this work, it is found that the 4th-IFCs of 2D-GaN are quite sensitive to atomic displacement in the finite difference method. The effects of the four-phonon scattering can be severely overestimated with non-convergent 4th-IFCs. The  κlat from three-phonon scattering is reduced by 65.6\% due to four-phonon scattering. The reflection symmetry allows significantly more four-phonon processes than three-phonon processes. It was previously thought the electron–phonon interactions have significant effects on the  κlat of two-dimensional materials. However, the effects of electron–phonon interactions on the  κlat of both n-type and p-type 2D-GaN at high charge carrier concentrations can be neglected due to the few phonon–electron scattering channels and the relatively strong four-phonon scattering.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}In atomistic simulations, the location of the saddle point on the potential-energy surface (PES) gives important information on transitions between local minima, for example, via transition-state theory. However, the search for saddle points often involves hundreds or thousands of ab initio force calls, which are typically all done at full accuracy. This results in the vast majority of the computational effort being spent calculating the electronic structure of states not important to the researcher, and very little time performing the calculation of the saddle point state itself. In this work, we describe how machine learning (ML) can reduce the number of intermediate ab initio calculations needed to locate saddle points. Since machine-learning models can learn from, and thus mimic, atomistic simulations, the saddle-point search can be conducted rapidly in the machine-learning representation. The saddle-point prediction can then be verified by an ab initio calculation; if it is incorrect, this strategically has identified regions of the PES where the machine-learning representation has insufficient training data. When these training data are used to improve the machine-learning model, the estimates greatly improve. This approach can be systematized, and in two simple example problems we demonstrate a dramatic reduction in the number of ab initio force calls. We expect that this approach and future refinements will greatly accelerate searches for saddle points, as well as other searches on the potential energy surface, as machine-learning methods see greater adoption by the atomistics community.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

However, its application has been restricted by its low efficiency and poor selectivity. Herein, atomically thin defective TiO2 is modified with iron tetraphenylporphyrin (FeTPP) to reinforce the selectivity of CO2 reduction. The synthesized Fe-TiO2-x photocatalyst exhibits a CH4 production rate of 20.48 μmol g−1 h−1 and a CH4 selectivity of 56.1\% under visible light irradiation. Oxygen vacancies (OVs) of defective TiO2 contributed to visible light absorption and FeTPP dispersion. The presence of FeTPP enhances the adsorption of CO intermediates, promoting the CH4 selectivity. The conduction band of Fe-TiO2-x lowers, inhibiting the CO generation. During the photoconversion process, CO2˙− and COOH− intermediate products were detected by in situ DRIFTS. The synergistic effect of OVs and FeTPP improves the efficiency and selectivity of CO2 photoreduction to CH4.

Optimized geometries, band-structures, phonon dispersion, binding energies, transmission electron microscopy images simulations, x-ray diffraction patterns, charge densities and electronic band gaps are calculated. We demonstrated that GaN Haeckelite structures are stable exhibiting a semiconducting behavior with an indirect band gap. Furthermore, it was found that GaN Haeckelite nanotubes are semiconductor with a band gap nature (direct or indirect) that depends of the nanotube´s chirality and diameter.

After doping, the Rc of WS2 and MoS2 have been decreased to 0.7 kΩ·μm and 0.5 kΩ·μm, respectively. The significant reduction of the Rc is attributed to the achieved high electron-doping density, thus a significant reduction of Schottky barrier width. As a proof-of-concept, high-performance few-layer WS2 field-effect transistors (FETs) are demonstrated, exhibiting a high drain current of 380 μA/μm, an on/off ratio of 4 × 106, and a peak field-effect mobility of 60 cm2/(V·s).

This analysis showed that higher defect concentrations result in longer excited-state lifetimes, which are attributed to improved charge separation and correlate well with the observed trends in the photocatalytic activity. In2O3-x(OH)y nanoparticles have been shown to function as an effective gas-phase photocatalyst for the reduction of CO2 to CO via the reverse water?gas shift reaction. Their photocatalytic activity is strongly correlated to the number of oxygen vacancy and hydroxide defects present in the system. To better understand how such defects interact with photogenerated electrons and holes in these materials, we have studied the relaxation dynamics of In2O3-x(OH)y nanoparticles with varying concentration of defects using two different excitation energies corresponding to above-band-gap (318-nm) and near-band-gap (405-nm) excitations. Our results demonstrate that defects play a significant role in the excited-state, charge relaxation pathways. Higher defect concentrations result in longer excited-state lifetimes, which are attributed to improved charge separation. This correlates well with the observed trends in the photocatalytic activity. These results are further supported by density-functional theory calculations, which confirm the positions of oxygen vacancy and hydroxide defect states within the optical band gap of indium oxide.

The chemically active Ni(I), even in a buried multilayer system, can be functionalized with nitrogen dioxide, allowing a selective tuning of the electronic properties of the Ni center that is switched to a [Ni(II), S = 1] state. While Ni acts as a reversible spin switch, it is found that the electronic structure of the macrocycle backbone, where the frontier orbitals are mainly localized, remains unaffected.

	abstract = {Abstract Electron spin plays a critical role in chemical processes, particularly in reactions involving metal complexes with unpaired electrons. However, more definitive state-to-state experiments are needed to better elucidate the role of electronic spin. Herein, we chose nickel (II) 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl) porphyrin 1 as a catalyst, which allows switching from a low spin to a high spin state of Ni (II) center through an axial pyridine coordination, for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). When pyridine is present, we observed ?-hydrogenation of porphyrin through electron transfer followed by proton transfer. In contrast, hydrogen evolution mainly occurs via the concerted proton-coupling electron transfer without pyridine coordination. Similar distinct spin-dependent selectivity was also observed in chemical reduction of 1 by CoCp2 with subsequent addition of pyridinium p-toluenesulfonate. Computational calculations using density functional theory demonstrated that the transition from low spin to high spin state enriches the ligand's electron density after one-electron reduction, leading to preferential protonation of ?-periphery rather than meso-position or metal center.},

Here, we theoretically design a mechanical spin-switch device in which external strain triggers the intrinsic magneto-structural coupling of FeP through a purely organic embedding. Exploiting the chemical compatibility and stretchability of graphene nanoribbon electrodes, we overcome common reliability and reproducibility issues of conventional inorganic setups. The competition between the Coulomb interaction and distortion-induced changes in ligand fields requires methodologies beyond the state-of-the-art: combining density functional theory with many-body techniques, we demonstrate experimentally feasible tensile strain to trigger a low-spin (S = 1) to high-spin (S = 2) crossover. Concomitantly, the current through the device toggles by over an order of magnitude, adding a fully planar mechanical current-switch unit to the panoply of molecular spintronics.},

At the molecular scale, scattering is mediated by the orbitals hosting the spin. Here we report the selective excitation of a molecular spin by tunneling through different molecular orbitals. Spatially resolved tunneling spectra on iron-porphyrins reveal that the inelastic spin excitation extends beyond the iron site, changing shape and symmetry along the molecule. Combining density functional theory simulations with a phenomenological scattering model, we show that the extension and lineshape of the inelastic signal are due to excitation pathways assisted by different frontier orbitals. By selecting the intramolecular site for electron injection, the relative weight of iron and pyrrole orbitals in the tunneling process is modified. Thus, the excitation mechanism, reflected by its spectral lineshape, depends on the degree of localization and energy alignment of the chosen molecular orbital.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We use on-surface synthesis to direct the hybrid creation by combining two molecular precursors on a gold surface. High-resolution imaging with a scanning tunneling microscope finds that the porphyrin core fuses into the graphene nanoribbons through the formation of new carbon rings at chemically predefined positions. These ensure the stability of the hybrid and the extension of the conjugated character of the ribbon into the molecule. By means of inelastic tunneling spectroscopy, we prove the survival of the magnetic functionality of the contacted porphyrin. The molecular spin appears unaffected by the graphenoid electrodes, and we simply observe that the magnetic anisotropy appears modified depending on the precise structure of the contacts.},

Recently, the reversible spin-switching of strapped Ni(II)-porphyrin complexes deposited on Ag(111) surface is demonstrated with low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). The spin transition is accompanied by the coordination change of the metal center, a phenomenon denominated in coordination-induced spin-state switching (CISSS). In this contribution, the spin switching of the deposited strapped Ni-porphyrin molecules using different quantum chemistry approaches is explored. This calculations inform about the geometry and electronic structure of the adsorbed molecules and the origin of the voltage-dependent switching promoted by the STM tip. Two different mechanisms are inspected to elucidate the key role of the tip, mainly the electron injection between the tip and the molecule and the differential stabilization of the two spin states by the applied electric field between the tip and the silver surface. This study puts in evidence the relevance of the pyridine ligand contained in the strap in the transport properties as in the CISSS process itself.},

	abstract = {Accurate computational treatment of spin states for transition metal complexes, exemplified by iron porphyrins, lies at the heart of quantum bioinorganic chemistry, but at the same time represents a great challenge for approximate density functional theory (DFT) methods, which are predominantly used. Here, the accuracy of DFT methods for spin-state splittings in iron porphyrin is assessed by probing the ability to correctly predict the ground states for six FeIII or FeII complexes experimentally characterized in solid state. For each case, molecular and periodic DFT calculations are employed to quantify the effect of porphyrin side substituents and the crystal packing effect (CPE) on the spin-state splitting. It is proposed to partition the total CPE into additive components, the direct and structural one, the importance of which is shown to significantly vary from case to case. By knowing the substituent effect, the CPE, and the Gibbs free energy thermodynamic correction from calculations, one can employ the experimental ground-state information in order to derive a quantitative constraint on the electronic energy difference for a simplified (porphin) model of the experimentally characterized metalloporphyrin. The constraints derived in such a way—in the form of single or double inequalities—are used to assess the accuracy of dispersion-corrected DFT methods for 6 spin-state splittings of [FeIII(P)(2-MeIm)2]+, [FeIII(P)(2-MeIm)]+, [FeII(P)(THF)2] and [FeII(P)] models (where P is porphin, 2-MeIm is 2-methylimidazole, THF is tetrahydrofuran). These data constitute the new benchmark set of spin states for crystalline iron porphyrins (SSCIP6). The highest accuracy is obtained in the case of double-hybrid functionals (B2PLYP-D3, DSD-PBEB95-D3), whereas hybrid functionals, especially those with reduced admixture of the exact exchange (B3LYP*-D3, TPSSh-D3), are found to considerably overstabilize the intermediate spin state, leading to incorrect ground-state prediction in FeIII porphyrins. The present approach, which can be generalized to other transition metal complexes, is not only useful in method benchmarking, but also sheds light on the interpretations of experimental data for metalloporphyrins, which are important models to understand the electronic properties of heme proteins.},

	abstract = {Green function and density functional theories are used to study electron transport characteristics through single molecules addressed by two metallic contacts. Each contact is modeled with one nanoscopic end connected to the molecule and one macroscopic end connected to an external potential difference. The method can be applied to any molecular system for which ab initio calculations can be performed. It allows us to determine the molecular orbitals participating in the electron-transfer process, the current−voltage characteristics of the junction, the density of states, and the transmission function, among other properties, providing a fundamental tool for the development of molecular electronics. The method is tested with Aun−S−(p-C6H4)−S−Aun (n = 1−5) connected to bulk gold. Current−voltage characteristics are in excellent agreement with a break junction experiment and with other ab initio calculations, yielding new insights regarding electron transport through single molecules.},

	abstract = {Efficient hydrogen production by water photocatalysis requires effective charge separation and optimal reactant-catalyst interactions. However, producing catalysts with these features is still challenging. Here, electrospinning and calcination were used to fabricate zirconium (Zr)-doped TiO2 nanofibers with controlled crystalline phase. In all tested nanofiber samples (pure TiO2 and after doping with different Zr amounts), TiO2 was detected mainly in the anatase form. All nanofibers displayed high purity and crystallinity. Moreover, X-ray photoemission spectroscopy showed that Zr was present as Zr4 + ions on the TiO2 surface. The Zr-doped TiO2 nanofiber band gaps (determined with the Kubelka–Munk function) ranged from 3.00 eV to 3.2 eV (vs 3.09 for TiO2). The absorption of visible light was improved in Zr-doped TiO2 nanofibers because Zr addition led to the creation of intermediate electronic levels between the conduction and valence bands, and to the decrease of the electron recombination rate. Then, Zr doping effect on TiO2 electronic structure and photocatalytic properties was evaluated by density functional theory modeling. The nanofibers with 4 mol\% of ZrOCl2·8 H2O exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity under visible light (hydrogen evolution rate of 2500 μmol·g⁻¹·h⁻¹, 23 times higher compared with pure TiO2 nanofibers). These one-dimensional nanostructures also showed excellent recyclability and sustained high photocatalytic efficiency, promising features for environmental and energy applications.},

Here, we study a polycrystalline spin crossover thin film as a prototypical example and reveal the sequential photo-switching dynamics, from local molecular rearrangement to global lattice deformation. On the earliest femtosecond timescale, the local molecular structural rearrangement occurs within a constant unit-cell volume through a two-step process, involving initial Fe−ligand bond elongation followed by ligand rotation. The highly-oriented structure of the nanocrystalline films and the experimental geometry enables resolving the full anisotropic lattice structural dynamics in and out of the sample plane separately. While both molecular switching and lattice heating influence lattice volume, they exert varying degrees of impact at disparate time scales following photoexcitation. This study highlights the opportunities provided by Mega-electron-volt electron and X-ray free electron laser to advance the understanding of ultrafast dynamics of photo-switchable materials.},

Kernel ridge regression is adopted to predict self-energy matrix elements on compact imaginary frequency grids from static and dynamical mean-field electronic features, which gives direct access to real-frequency many-body Green’s functions through analytic continuation and Dyson’s equation. Feature and self-energy matrices are represented in a symmetry-adapted intrinsic atomic orbital plus projected atomic orbital basis to enforce rotational invariance. We demonstrate good transferability and high data efficiency of the proposed ML method across molecular sizes and chemical species by showing accurate predictions of density of states (DOS) and quasiparticle energies at the level of many-body perturbation theory (GW) or full configuration interaction. For the ML model trained on 48 out of 1995 molecules randomly sampled from the QM7 and QM9 data sets, we report the mean absolute errors of ML-predicted highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energies to be 0.13 and 0.10 eV, respectively, compared to GW@PBE0. We further showcase the capability of this method by applying the same ML model to predict DOS for significantly larger organic molecules with up to 44 heavy atoms.},

	abstract = {Plasmon-induced hot-carrier transfer from a metal nanostructure to an acceptor is known to occur via two key mechanisms: (i) indirect transfer, where the hot carriers are produced in the metal nanostructure and subsequently transferred to the acceptor, and (ii) direct transfer, where the plasmons decay by directly exciting carriers from the metal to the acceptor. Unfortunately, an atomic-level understanding of the direct-transfer process, especially with regard to its quantification, remains elusive even though it is estimated to be more efficient compared to the indirect-transfer process. This is due to experimental challenges in separating direct from indirect transfer as both processes occur simultaneously at femtosecond time scales. Here, we employ time-dependent density-functional theory simulations to isolate and study the direct-transfer process at a model metal-acceptor (Ag 147 -Cd 33 Se 33 ) interface. Our simulations show that, for a 10 fs Gaussian laser pulse tuned to the plasmon frequency, the plasmon formed in the Ag 147 -Cd 33 Se 33 system decays within 10 fs and induces the direct transfer with a probability of about 40\%. We decompose the direct-transfer process further and demonstrate that the direct injection of both electrons and holes into the acceptor, termed direct hot-electron transfer (DHET) and direct hot-hole transfer (DHHT), takes place with similar probabilities of about 20\% each. Finally, effective strategies to control and tune the probabilities of DHET and DHHT processes are proposed. We envision our work to provide guidelines toward the design of metal-acceptor interfaces that enable more efficient plasmonic hot-carrier devices.},

	abstract = {The insulating nature of the redox end members in Li-S batteries, α-S and Li2S, has the potential to limit the capacity and efficiency of this emerging energy storage system. Nevertheless, the mechanisms responsible for ionic and electronic transport in these materials remain a matter of debate. The present study clarifies these mechanisms - in both the adiabatic and nonadiabatic charge transfer regimes - by employing a combination of hybrid-functional-based and constrained density functional theory calculations. Charge transfer in Li2S is predicted to be adiabatic, and thus is well-described by conventional DFT methodologies. In sulfur, however, transitions between S8 rings are nonadiabatic. In this case, conventional DFT overestimates charge transfer rates by up to 2 orders of magnitude. Delocalized holes, and to a lesser extent, localized electron polarons, are predicted to be the most mobile electronic charge carriers in α-S; in Li2S, hole polarons dominate. Although all carriers exhibit extremely low equilibrium concentrations, and thus yield negligible contributions to the conductivity, their mobilities are sufficient to enable the sulfur loading targets necessary for high energy densities. Our results highlight the value of methods capable of capturing nonadiabaticity, such as constrained DFT. These techniques are especially important for molecular crystals such as α-S, where longer-range charge transfer events are expected. Combining the present computational results with prior experimental studies, we conclude that low equilibrium carrier concentrations are responsible for sluggish charge transport in α-S and Li2S. Thus, a potential strategy for improving the performance of Li-S batteries is to increase the concentrations of holes in these redox end members.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Excited carrier dynamics in plasmonic nanostructures determines many important optical properties such as nonlinear optical response and photocatalytic activity. Here it is shown that mesoscopic plasmonic covellite nanocrystals with low free‐carrier concentration exhibit a much faster carrier relaxation than in traditional plasmonic materials. A nonequilibrium hot‐carrier population thermalizes within first 20 fs after photoexcitation. A decreased thermalization time in nanocrystals compared to a bulk covellite is consistent with the reduced Coulomb screening in ultrathin films. The subsequent relaxation of thermalized, equilibrium electron gas is faster than in traditional plasmonic metals due to the lower carrier concentration and agrees well with that in a bulk covellite showing no evidence of quantum confinement or hot‐hole trapping at the surface states. The excitation of coherent optical phonon modes in a covellite is also demonstrated, revealing coherent lattice dynamics in plasmonic materials, which until now was mainly limited to dielectrics, semiconductors, and semimetals. These findings show advantages of this new mesoscopic plasmonic material for active control of optical processes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Though some of the structural heterogeneity can be studied by methods like X-ray crystallography, NMR, or cryo-electron microscopy, these methods fail to explain the detailed conformational transitions and dynamics. The dynamic structural states in proteins are covered in magnitude between 10-11 and 10-6 m and time-scales from 10-12 s to 10-5 s. For a comprehensive analysis of the biomolecular dynamics, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation has evolved as the most powerful technique. With the advent of high-end computational power, MD simulations can be performed between μs to the ms time-scale that can accurately describe the dynamics of any system. Various force fields like GROMOS, AMBER, and CH ARMM have been developed for MD simulations. Tools like GROMACS, AMBER, CHARMM-GUI, and NAMD are the most widely used methods for MD simulation that can provide precise information on the motions and flexibility of a protein, which contributes to the interaction dynamics of protein-ligand complexes. MD simulation has several other practical applications in diverse research areas, including molecular docking and drug design, refining protein structure predictions, and studying the unfolding pathway of a protein. Combining MD simulation with wet-lab experiments has b come an indispensable complement in the investigation of several important and intricate biological processes. Various tools like principal component analysis, cross-correlation analysis, and residues interaction network analysis are additional useful approaches for analyzing MD data. In this chapter, we will discuss MD simulation for a layman understanding and explain how it can be used for protein-ligand characterization as well as for use in diverse biomolecular applications.},

Small-molecule ligands BT13 and BT18 show an effect on GDNF family receptor GFRα1 and RET receptor tyrosine kinase RetA function. Thus, their potential binding sites and interactions were explored in the GDNF-GFRα1-RetA complex using molecular docking calculations as well as molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Three possible regions were examined: the interface between GDNF and GFRα1 (region A), the RetA interface with GFRα1 (region B), and a possible allosteric site in GFRα1 (region C). The results obtained by the docking calculations and the MD simulations indicate that the preferable binding occurs at the allosteric site. A less preferable binding site was detected on the RetA surface interfacing GFRα1. In the membrane-bound state of RetA this can enable compounds BT13 and BT18 to act as direct RetA agonists. The analysis of the MD simulations shows hydrogen bonds for BT13 and significant hydrophobic interactions with GFRα1 for BT13 and BT18 at the allosteric site.},

Embedding a Fe atom in the porphyrin causes spin-polarized ground state (S = 1). Using density functional theory and nonequilibrium Green’s function, we examine a 2-terminal setup involving a Fe-Por-GNR between small band gap, Por-GNR electrodes. The coupling between the Fe-d and GNR band states results in a Fano anti-resonance feature in the spin transport, making the conductance highly sensitive to the Fe spin state. We demonstrate how mechanical strain or chemical adsorption on the Fe give rise to spin-crossover to S = 2 and S = 0, directly reflected in the transmission.

We then summarize the recent experimental progress and approaches to induce and control structural chirality in 2D materials from monolayers to superlattices.

Their functional properties, such as the absorption and emission of circularly polarized light or the transport of spin-polarized electrons, are highly anisotropic. As a result, the orientation of chiral molecules critically determines the functionality and efficiency of chiral devices. Here we present a strategy to control the orientation of a small chiral molecule (2,2′-dicyano[6]helicene) by the use of organic and inorganic templating layers. Such templating layers can either force 2,2′-dicyano[6]helicene to adopt a face-on orientation and self-assemble into upright supramolecular columns oriented with their helical axis perpendicular to the substrate, or an edge-on orientation with parallel-lying supramolecular columns. Through such control, we show that low- and high-energy chiroptical responses can be independently ‘turned on’ or ‘turned off’. The templating methodologies described here provide a simple way to engineer orientational control and, by association, anisotropic functional properties of chiral molecular systems for a range of emerging technologies.},

In this study, we propose a deep neural network-based forward design approach that enables an efficient search for superior materials far beyond the domain of the initial training set. This approach compensates for the weak predictive power of neural networks on an unseen domain through gradual updates of the neural network with active transfer learning and data augmentation methods. We demonstrate the potential of our framework with a grid composite optimization problem that has an astronomical number of possible design configurations.

	abstract = {ConspectusDesigning new materials is vital for addressing pressing societal challenges in health, energy, and sustainability. The combination of physicochemical laws and empirical trial and error has long guided material design, but this approach is limited by the cost of experiments and the difficulty of deriving complex guiding principles. The space of hypothetical materials to be considered is incredibly large, and only a small fraction of possible compounds can ever be tested experimentally. The computational techniques of atomistic simulation and machine learning (ML) offer an avenue to rapidly invent new materials and navigate this enormous space. Together, they can be used to infer complex design principles and identify high-quality candidates more rapidly than trial-and-error experimentation. In this Account, we review our group's recent contributions to simulation and ML for materials design. We begin by discussing the numerical representation of materials for use in ML. Representations can be produced through deterministic algorithms, learnable encodings, or physics-based methods and lead to vector, graph, and matrix outputs. We describe how these different approaches offer distinct material- and application-specific advantages. We provide demonstrations from our own work on small-molecule drugs, macromolecules, dyes, electrolytes, and zeolites. In several cases, we show how the appropriate representation led to guiding principles that facilitated experimental materials design. Next, we highlight the development of ML methods for enhancing atomistic simulation. These advances help to improve simulation accuracy and expand the time and length scales that can be explored. They include differentiable atomistic simulations in which ensemble-averaged quantities are differentiated with respect to system parameters, and novel autoregressive methods for enhanced sampling of challenging physical distributions. Other developments include learnable coarse-grained models, which can accelerate molecular dynamics while minimizing the loss of all-atom information, and ML interatomic potentials, which can be trained on maximally informative quantum chemistry data through active learning and adversarial uncertainty attacks. Next, we show how these combined computational advances have enabled high-throughput virtual screening. This has led to the discovery of low-cost organic structure-directing agents for zeolite synthesis, polymer electrolytes, and efficient photoswitches for targeted medicine. We conclude by discussing the limitations of ML and simulation. These include the large data requirements and limited chemical transferability of the former and the speed-accuracy trade-offs of the latter. We predict that advancements in quantum chemistry will further accelerate simulations, while the incorporation of physical principles will improve the reliability of ML.},

However, this enhancement demands a more comprehensive understanding and improved surveillance of the essential mechanisms that control battery functionality over their entire lifespan. Unfortunately, from the moment batteries are sealed until their end of life, they remain a ‘black box’, and our knowledge of the health status of a commercial battery is limited to current (I), voltage (V), temperature (T) and impedance (R) measurements, at the cell or even module level during use, leading to an over-reliance on insufficient data to establish conservative safety margins and a systematic under-utilization of cells and batteries. Although the field of operando characterization is not new, the emergence of techniques capable of tracking commercial battery properties under realistic conditions has unlocked a trove of chemical, thermal and mechanical data that have the potential to revolutionize the development and utilization strategies of both new and used lithium-ion devices.

	abstract = {Cooperativity among spin centres has long been the royal road in spin crossover (SCO) research to impose magnetic bistability in terms of thermal hysteresis. In this work we access magnetic multi-inert states of the iron(III) compound \{FeL2[B(Ph)4]\} ≡ FeB at low temperature, in addition to thermal bistability. The packing of the low-spin and high-spin forms of crystalline FeB differs only marginally what ultimately leads to structural conservatism. This indicates that the SCO-immanent breathing of the complex cation is almost fully compensated by the anion matrix. The unique cooling rate dependence of the residual low-temperature magnetisation in FeB unveils continuous switching between the trapped high-spin (ON) and the relaxed low-spin state (OFF). The macroscopic ratio of the spin states (ON:OFF) can be adjusted as a simple function of the cooling rate. That is, cooperative spin crossover can be the source of bistable and multi-inert system states in the very same material.},

	abstract = {Lithium iron phosphate is one of the most promising positive-electrode materials for the next generation of lithium-ion batteries that will be used in electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. Lithium deintercalation (intercalation) proceeds through a two-phase reaction between compositions very close to LiFePO4 and FePO4. As both endmember phases are very poor ionic and electronic conductors, it is difficult to understand the intercalation mechanism at the microscopic scale. Here, we report a characterization of electrochemically deintercalated nanomaterials by X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy that shows the coexistence of fully intercalated and fully deintercalated individual particles. This result indicates that the growth reaction is considerably faster than its nucleation. The reaction mechanism is described by a ‘domino-cascade model’ and is explained by the existence of structural constraints occurring just at the reaction interface: the minimization of the elastic energy enhances the deintercalation (intercalation) process that occurs as a wave moving through the entire crystal. This model opens new perspectives in the search for new electrode materials even with poor ionic and electronic conductivities.},

	abstract = {LiFePO4, as the most famous member of the family of olivine-type lithium transition metal phosphates, is one of the promising candidates for the cathodes of lithium-ion batteries. However, its battery performance is limited by its low electrical conductivity and slow Li solid-state diffusion. Various methods have been attempted to improve the battery performance of lithium iron phosphate. Among them, compositing the LiFePO4with carbon nanomaterials seems to be the most promising, as it is facile and efficient. Carbon nanomaterials usually serve as a conductive agent to improve the electrical conductivity while increasing the material porosity in which the solid-state diffusion distances are significantly shortened. Owing to the popularity of various carbonaceous nanomaterials, there is no straightforward line of research for comparing the LiFePO4/C nanocomposites. This review aims to provide a general perspective based on the research achievements reported in the literature. While surveying the research findings reported in the literature, controversial issues are also discussed. The possible contribution of pseudocapacitance as a result of functionalized carbon or LiFePO4lattice defects is described, since from a practical perspective, a LiFePO4/C electrode can be considered as a supercapacitor at high C rates (with a specific capacitance as large as 200 F g−1). The Li diffusion in LiFePO4has not been well understood yet; while the Li diffusion within the LiFePO4lattice seems to be quite fast, the peculiar interfacial electrochemistry of LiFePO4slows down the diffusion within the entire electrode by a few orders of magnitude.},

A few phase transition-coupled SCO compounds have been reported, yet the synergy between SCO and phase transition on different time scales has not been explored. Herein, we report an [Fe(H-5-Cl-thsa-Et)(5-Cl-thsa-Et)]·H2O (1·H2O; H2-5-Cl-thsa-Et = 5-chloro-salicylaldehyde ethylthiosemicarbazone) Fe(III) complex that displays a two-dimensional supramolecular structure and SCO behavior above room temperature. Its dehydrated form 1 exhibits a two-step spin transition with a plateau in the temperature-dependent magnetization (M−T) curve at room temperature and a 51 K thermal hysteresis loop (Tc↑↓ = 299/248 K) at a rate of 5 K/min. The improved SCO performance in 1 could be attributed to the stronger intralayer but weaker interlayer interactions, which is supported by single-crystal structural analysis and density functional theory calculations. Remarkably, complex 1 displays an unusual scan rate-dependent SCO behavior at rates of 0.5−30 K/ min, in which M−T curve plateaus appear at lower scan rates ({\textless}10 K/min) but vanish at faster scan rates (≥10 K/min). Scan rate-dependent differential scanning calorimetry, powder X-ray diffractometry, time-dependent magnetic moment decays, and infrared spectroscopy consistently reveal that the slow structural relaxation is coupled with a slow crystallographic phase transition, which is the mechanism for the unusual scan rate-dependent SCO.},

The toroidal dipole is a localized electromagnetic excitation, distinct from the magnetic and electric dipoles. While the electric dipole can be understood as a pair of opposite charges and the magnetic dipole as a current loop, the toroidal dipole corresponds to currents flowing on the surface of a torus. Toroidal dipoles provide physically significant contributions to the basic characteristics of matter including absorption, dispersion and optical activity. Toroidal excitations also exist in free space as spatially and temporally localized electromagnetic pulses propagating at the speed of light and interacting with matter. We review recent experimental observations of resonant toroidal dipole excitations in metamaterials and the discovery of anapoles, non-radiating charge-current configurations involving toroidal dipoles. While certain fundamental and practical aspects of toroidal electrodynamics remain open for the moment, we envision that exploitation of toroidal excitations can have important implications for the fields of photonics, sensing, energy and information.},

Our results show that the bridge adsorption site is preferred over the on-top and fourfold hollow ones for both spin states, although they are energetically close. The LS molecule is stabilized by the surface, and the HS–LS energy difference is enhanced by about 15\%–25\% once deposited. The different Fe ligand field for LS and HS molecules manifests on the composition and energy of the low-lying bands. Our simulated STM images indicate that it is possible to distinguish the spin state of the deposited molecules by tuning the bias voltage of the STM tip. Finally, it should be noted that the use of a reduced size cluster to simulate the Au(100) surface proves to be a low-cost and reliable strategy, providing results in good agreement with those resulting from state-of-the-art periodic calculations for this system.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Here we tackle this problem with Hubbard-U corrected van der Waals density functional (vdW-DF), incorporating strong correlation effects of the localized electrons and dispersion interactions involved in the molecule-surface binding. By fitting the spin state energetics of a series of Fe(ii) compounds with varying ligand field strength, we find that the optimal U value for vdW-DF is much smaller than that for the local density approximation (LDA) while quite similar to that for the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). We show that although vdW-DF+U overestimates largely the metal-ligand bond distance, the predicted adiabatic high-spin-low-spin energy splitting ΔEHL is only slightly changed with respect to that obtained using the LDA+U geometries consistent with experiment. Then we use Cu(111)-supported metallocene (M(C5H5)2, M = Fe, and Co) as a prototype example to explore the effects of the molecule-surface interactions. We show that the non-local dispersion interactions, poorly described by LDA and GGA while reasonably captured by vdW-DF, are critical for reproducing ΔEHL at large molecule-surface distances. Besides, we find that ΔEHL is decreased by the molecule-metal contact, which is shown to weaken the local ligand field around the magnetic center.},

For [Fe\{H2B(pz)2\}2(bipy)] films of hundreds of nm thick, magnetometry and x-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements show thermal hysteresis in the SCO transition with temperature, although the transition in bulk [Fe\{H2B(pz)2\}2(bipy)] occurs in a non-hysteretic fashion at 157 K. While the size of the crystallites in those films are similar, the hysteresis becomes more prominent in thinner films, indicating a significant effect of the [Fe\{H2B(pz)2\}2(bipy)]/Al2O3 interface. Bistability of spin states, which can be inferred from the thermal hysteresis, was directly observed using temperature-dependent x-ray diffraction; the crystallites behave as spin-state domains that coexist during the transition. The difference between the spin state of molecules at the surface of the [Fe\{H2B(pz)2\}2(bipy)] films and that of the molecules within the films, during the thermal cycle, indicates that both cooperative (intermolecular) effects and coordination are implicated in perturbations to the SCO transition.},

	abstract = {This article, examines the flow of argon inside a nanochannel with respect to the molecular dynamics (MD) in the free molecular flow regime using LAMMPS software. The nanochannel is made of copper featuring a square cross-section and obstacles of varying dimensions and values. In this study, the flow of argon fluid is three-dimensional. To gain a deeper understanding of the effect of solid walls within the nanochannel and their influence on flow behavior, the research is simulated in a nanochannel with all side walls for the 3D model and without side walls for the 2D model. This research assesses the effect of the obstacles’ dimensions and values on the nanochannel wall surface and areas above the wall surface. The total dimensions of all simulated two- and three-dimensional atomic structures with a square cross-section are assumed to be 60 × 60 × 100 Å3. and the presence of square obstacles (with dimensions of 8 × 8 × 8 Å3) and rectangular obstacles (with dimensions of 8 × 18 × 8 Å3) is examined. This study seeks to understand the influence on flow behavior, temperature distribution, density, heat flux, velocity, and thermal conductivity coefficient. This study is simulated using a time step of 1 fs for 10,000 time steps, involving approximately 10,000–15,000 argon and copper atoms. The results of this research indicate that obstacles with structures of P and R and larger dimensions increase the number of solid atoms exhibiting stronger attractive forces. Compared to a smooth nanochannel, the thermal exchange between fluid and solid atoms results in a density increase of 17.5 \% and 17.3 \%, respectively. On the other hand, in the 3D nanochannel, the sidewalls of the nanochannel have reduced the effect of the presence of R and P obstacles with larger dimensions, which comparing to a smooth nanochannel, have increased the density by 8.21 \% and 7.53 \%, respectively. The obstacles with different spatial positions (P and R structures) in the two-dimensional nanochannel cause a rise in the thermal conductivity coefficient. The P structure obstacles have a better effect on the thermal conductivity coefficient in the 2D nanochannel compared to the R structure. In the three-dimensional nanochannel, utilizing smaller obstacles proves to be more effective because it results in better atom distribution or temperature distribution due to increased atomic collisions in the central region compared to the wall regions.},

	abstract = {Orthologous proteins of species adapted to different temperatures exhibit differences in stability and function that are interpreted to reflect adaptive variation in structural ?flexibility.? However, quantifying flexibility and comparing flexibility across proteins has remained a challenge. To address this issue, we examined temperature effects on cytosolic malate dehydrogenase (cMDH) orthologs from differently thermally adapted congeners of five genera of marine molluscs whose field body temperatures span a range of ?60 °C. We describe consistent patterns of convergent evolution in adaptation of function [temperature effects on KM of cofactor (NADH)] and structural stability (rate of heat denaturation of activity). To determine how these differences depend on flexibilities of overall structure and of regions known to be important in binding and catalysis, we performed molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) analyses. MDS analyses revealed a significant negative correlation between adaptation temperature and heat-induced increase of backbone atom movements [root mean square deviation (rmsd) of main-chain atoms]. Root mean square fluctuations (RMSFs) of movement by individual amino acid residues varied across the sequence in a qualitatively similar pattern among orthologs. Regions of sequence involved in ligand binding and catalysis?termed mobile regions 1 and 2 (MR1 and MR2), respectively?showed the largest values for RMSF. Heat-induced changes in RMSF values across the sequence and, importantly, in MR1 and MR2 were greatest in cold-adapted species. MDS methods are shown to provide powerful tools for examining adaptation of enzymes by providing a quantitative index of protein flexibility and identifying sequence regions where adaptive change in flexibility occurs.},

This study uses density functional theory calculations to investigate how spin state energetics and molecular vibrations change in a Fe(II) SCO compound named [Fe(py)2bpym(NCS)2] when deposited on an Al(100) surface. The calculations consider an environment-dependent U to assess the local Coulomb correlation of 3d electrons. The results show that the adsorption configurations heavily affect the spin state splitting, which increases by 10–40 kJmol−1 on the surface, and this is detrimental to spin conversion. This effect is due to the surface binding energy variation across the spin transition. The preference for the low-spin state originates partly from the strong correlation effect. Furthermore, the surface environment constrains the vibrational entropy difference, which decreases by 8–17 Jmol−1K−1 (at 300 K) and leads to higher critical temperatures. These results suggest that the electronic energy splitting and vibrational level shifting are suitable features for characterizing the spin transition process on surfaces, and they can provide access to high-throughput screening of spin crossover devices.},

	abstract = {We present an ab initio study on quasiparticle (QP) excitations and excitonic effects in two-dimensional (2D) GaN based on density-functional theory and many-body perturbation theory. We calculate the QP band structure using GW approximation, which generates an indirect band gap of 4.83 eV (K→Γ) for 2D GaN, opening up 1.24 eV with respect to its bulk counterpart. It is shown that the success of plasmon-pole approximation in treating the 2D material benefits considerably from error cancellation. On the other hand, much better gaps, comparable to GW ones, could be obtained by correcting the Kohn–Sham gap with a derivative discontinuity of the exchange–correlation functional at much lower computational cost. To evaluate excitonic effects, we solve the Bethe–Salpeter equation (BSE) starting from Kohn–Sham eigenvalues with a scissors operator to open the single-particle gap. This approach yields an exciton binding energy of 1.23 eV in 2D GaN, which is in good agreement with the highly demanding GW-BSE results. The enhanced excitonic effects due to reduced dimensionality are discussed by comparing the optical spectra from BSE calculations with that by random-phase approximation (RPA) for both the monolayer and bulk GaN in wurtzite phase. Additionally, we find that the spin–orbit splitting of excitonic peaks is noticeable in 2D GaN but buried in the bulk crystal.},

Here we report on the electrically driven spin transition in manganocene physisorbed on a metallic surface in two different adsorption configurations predicted by ab initio techniques, including a Hubbard-U correction at the manganese site and accounting for the long-range van der Waals interactions. We show that the application of an electric field at the interface induces a high-spin to low-spin transition in the flat-lying manganocene, while it could hardly alter the high-spin ground state of the standing-up molecule. This phenomenon cannot be explained by either the molecule-metal charge transfer or the local electron correlation effects. We demonstrate a linear dependence of the intra-molecular spin-state splitting on the energy difference between crystal-field splitting and on-site Coulomb repulsion. After considering the molecule-surface binding energy shifts upon spin transition, we reproduce the obtained spin-state energetics. We find that the configuration-dependent responses of the spin-transition originate from the binding energy shifts instead of the variation of the local ligand field. Through these analyses, we obtain an intuitive understanding of the effects of molecule-surface contact on spin-crossover under electrical bias.},

	abstract = {The electronic structures of the cubic GdH3 are extensively investigated using the ab initio many-body GW calculations treating the Gd 4f electrons either in the core (4f-core) or in the valence states (4f-val). Different degrees of quasiparticle (QP) self-consistent calculations with the different starting points are used to correct the failures of the GGA/GGA + U/HSE03 calculations. In the 4f-core case, GGA + G0W0 calculations give a fundamental band gap of 1.72 eV, while GGA+ GW0 or GGA + GW calculations present a larger band gap. In the 4f-val case, the nonlocal exchange-correlation (xc) functional HSE03 can account much better for the strong localization of the 4f states than the semilocal or Hubbard U corrected xc functional in the Kohn–Sham equation. We show that the fundamental gap of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) or ferromagnetic (FM) GdH3 can be opened up by solving the QP equation with improved starting point of eigenvalues and wave functions given by HSE03. The HSE03 + G0W0 calculations present a fundamental band gap of 2.73 eV in the AFM configuration, and the results of the corresponding GW0 and GW calculations are 2.89 and 3.03 eV, respectively. In general, for the cubic structure, the fundamental gap from G0W0 calculations in the 4f-core case is the closest to the real result. By G0W0 calculations in the 4f-core case, we find that H or Gd defects can strongly affect the band structure, especially the H defects. We explain the mechanism in terms of the possible electron correlation on the hydrogen site. Under compression, the insulator-to-metal transition in the cubic GdH3 occurs around 40 GPa, which might be a satisfied prediction.},

This task is still a challenge for the widely used local density or generalized gradient approximations (LDA/GGA) and hybrid functionals. One remedy, termed density functional theory plus U (DFT+U) approach, introduces a Hubbard U term to deal with the localized electrons at marginal computational cost, while treats the delocalized electrons with LDA/GGA. Here, we employ the DFT+U approach to investigate the Tc of a pair of iron(II) SCO molecular crystals (α and β phase), where identical constituent molecules are packed in different ways. We first calculate the adiabatic high spin-low spin energy splitting ΔEHL and molecular vibrational frequencies in both spin states, then obtain the temperature dependent enthalpy and entropy changes (ΔH and ΔS), and finally extract Tc by exploiting the ΔH/T − T and ΔS − T relationships. The results are in agreement with experiment. Analysis of geometries and electronic structures shows that the local ligand field in the α phase is slightly weakened by the H-bondings involving the ligand atoms and the specific crystal packing style. We find that this effect is largely responsible for the difference in Tc of the two phases. This study shows the applicability of the DFT+U approach for predicting Tc of SCO materials, and provides a clear insight into the subtle influence of the crystal packing effects on SCO behavior.},

We find that the significant charge transfer between the molecule and the metallic surface plays a dominant role in the spin reorientation transition.

The main advantage of DFT-D3 is its computational efficiency and robustness across the periodic table, which makes this approach particularly valuable for the treatment of large systems. DFT-D3 has been published in three variations, which are all discussed herein. Extensions that allow the treatment of three-body dispersion effects, as well as the treatment of periodic systems, are also reviewed. This chapter concludes with a brief overview of DFT-D3's performance for noncovalent interaction energies, thermochemistry and geometry optimizations.

Our results show that the adsorption on the metallic surface enhances the transition energy, increasing the relative stability of the low spin (LS) state. The interaction indeed is spin‐dependent, stronger for the low spin than the high spin (HS) state. The different strength of the Fe ligand field at low and high temperature manifests on the nature, spatial extension and relative energy of the states close to the Fermi level, with a larger metal–ligand hybridization in the LS state. This feature is of relevance for the differential adsorption of the LS and HS molecules, the spin‐dependent conductance, and for the differences found in the corresponding STM images, correctly reproduced from the density of states provided by the rPBE calculations. It is expected that this spin dependence will be a general feature of the SCO molecule–substrate interaction, since it is rooted in the different ligand field of Fe site at low and high temperatures, a common hallmark of the Fe $^{\textrm{II}}$ SCO complexes. Finally, the states involved in the LIESST phenomenon has been identified through NEVPT2 calculations on a model reaction path. A tentative pathway for the photoinduced LS→HS transition is proposed, that does not involve the intermediate triplet states, and nicely reproduces both the blue laser wavelength required for the activation, and the wavelength of the reverse HS → LS transition. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Scanning tunneling microscopy confirms that [Fe(H2B(pz)2)2(bipy)] grows as ordered, molecular bilayer islands at sub-monolayer coverage and as disordered film at higher coverage. The temperature dependence of the electronic structure suggest that the SCO films exhibit a mixture of spin states at room temperature, but upon cooling below the spin crossover transition the film spin state is best described as a mix of high-spin and low-spin state molecules of a ratio that is constant. This locking of the spin state is most likely the result of a substrate-induced conformational change of the interfacial molecules, but it is estimated that also the intra-atomic electron–electron Coulomb correlation energy, or Hubbard correlation energy U, could be an additional contributing factor.},

The electronic decay from the initial optically excited electronic state towards the high spin state is distinguished from the structural trapping dynamics, which launches a coherent oscillating wave packet (265 fs period), clearly identified as molecular breathing. Throughout the structural trapping, the dispersion of the wave packet along the reaction coordinate reveals details of intramolecular vibronic coupling before a slower vibrational energy dissipation to the solution environment.

	abstract = {Electronic structure calculations have become an indispensable tool in many areas of materials science and quantum chemistry. Even though the Kohn-Sham formulation of the density-functional theory (DFT) simplifies the many-body problem significantly, one is still confronted with several numerical challenges. In this article we present the projector augmented-wave (PAW) method as implemented in the GPAW program package (https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/gpaw) using a uniform real-space grid representation of the electronic wavefunctions. Compared to more traditional plane wave or localized basis set approaches, real-space grids offer several advantages, most notably good computational scalability and systematic convergence properties. However, as a unique feature GPAW also facilitates a localized atomic-orbital basis set in addition to the grid. The efficient atomic basis set is complementary to the more accurate grid, and the possibility to seamlessly switch between the two representations provides great flexibility. While DFT allows one to study ground state properties, time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) provides access to the excited states. We have implemented the two common formulations of TDDFT, namely the linear-response and the time propagation schemes. Electron transport calculations under finite-bias conditions can be performed with GPAW using non-equilibrium Green functions and the localized basis set. In addition to the basic features of the real-space PAW method, we also describe the implementation of selected exchange-correlation functionals, parallelization schemes, ΔSCF-method, x-ray absorption spectra, and maximally localized Wannier orbitals. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Yet, the excess heat capacity associated with the molecular spin‐state switching has never been explored for practical applications. Herein, the thermal damping effect of an SCO film is experimentally assessed by monitoring the transient heating response of SCO‐coated metallic microwires, Joule‐heated by current pulses. A damping of the wire temperature, up to 10\%, is evidenced on a time scale of tens of microseconds due to the spin‐state switching of the molecular film. Fast heat‐charging dynamics and negligible fatigability are demonstrated, which, together with the solid‐solid nature of the spin transition, appear as promising features for achieving thermal energy management applications in functional devices.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The change in spin states affects the spatial distribution of electron density through the spin orbit coupling interaction. The subsequent nuclear reorganization reports on the full extent of the spin induced change in electron distribution, which can be treated similarly to intramolecular charge transfer with effective reaction coordinates depicting the spin transition. Here, single-crystal [FeII(bpy)3](PF6)2, a prototypical system for spin crossover (SCO) dynamics, is studied using ultrafast electron diffraction in the single-photon excitation regime. The photoinduced SCO dynamics are resolved, revealing two distinct processes with a (450 ± 20)-fs fast component and a (2.4 ± 0.4)-ps slow component. Using principal component analysis, we uncover the key structural modes, ultrafast Fe–N bond elongations coupled with ligand motions, that define the effective reaction coordinate to fully capture the relevant molecular reorganization. Electron spin is a fundamental property of molecules, and changes in spin state affect both\&nbsp;molecular structure and dynamics.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} Electron-vibration coupling is of critical importance for the development of molecular electronics, spintronics, and quantum technologies, as it affects transport properties and spin dynamics. The control over charge-state transitions and subsequent molecular vibrations using scanning tunneling microscopy typically requires the use of a decoupling layer. Here we show the vibronic excitations of tetrabromotetraazapyrene (TBTAP) molecules directly adsorbed on Ag(111) into an orientational glassy phase. The electron-deficient TBTAP is singly-occupied by an electron donated from the substrate, resulting in a spin 1/2 state, which is confirmed by a Kondo resonance. The TBTAP $^{\textrm{•−}}$ discharge is controlled by tip-gating and leads to a series of peaks in scanning tunneling spectroscopy. These occurrences are explained by combining a double-barrier tunneling junction with a Franck-Condon model including molecular vibrational modes. This work demonstrates that suitable precursor design enables gate-dependent vibrational excitations of molecules on a metal, thereby providing a method to investigate electron-vibration coupling in molecular assemblies without a decoupling layer. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The STM images clearly illustrate the adsorption configurations of both the first and second monolayers (MLs). The IETS signal of the FePc at the first ML of FePc lattice is suppressed by the interaction with the Au substrate. The IETS spectra for the molecules at the second ML differ depending on the adsorption configuration; the molecules inside the 2D lattice, which are strongly tilted from the surface normal, show a set of peaks and dips attributed to out-of-plane vibration modes. In contrast, the less tilted molecules at the edge do not show IETS signals. This study demonstrates that the STM-IETS is still sensitive for the local vibrational properties at 77 K.},

Potential solutions have the possibility to be uncovered by revealing hidden patterns within the material data. Data science is therefore implemented in order to link the material data to the crystal structure. In particular, unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques are used where the Gaussian mixture model is employed in order to understand the data structure of the materials database while random forest classification is used to predict the crystal structure. As a result, the unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques reveal descriptors for determining the crystal structure via the materials database. In addition, predicting atomic combinations from the crystal structure is also achieved using a trained machine where the first-principles calculations confirm the stability of predicted materials. Thus, one can consider that the estimation of the crystal structure can be achieved in principle via the combination of material data and machine learning, thereby leading to the advancement of crystal structure prediction.},

The method extends beyond the usual wide-band limit approximation, and its generality allows its use with any level of electronic structure theory. We demonstrate its ability to predict the broadening and shifting of MELs as a function of intramolecular coupling, molecule/surface coupling, and the surface density of states for a molecule with two MELs adsorbed on a one-dimensional model metal surface. The new approach could help provide guidelines for the design and experimental characterization of electrochemical devices with optimal electron transport.},

Our ab initio calculations are based on the density functional theory (DFT) and have been conducted using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA, with PW91 \& PBE versions) as well as GGA + U approach, in which an additional Hubbard-U term is added for the treatment of strong on-site 3d electron-electron interactions on Fe. We have, first, optimized the atomic distances for the porphyrin models by minimizing the total energy. Second, we benchmarked our computational approach by comparison to existing calculated results for relatively small porphyrin models obtained by the Becke-Lee-Yang-Parr (BLYP) exchange-correlation functional. We have considered several models of ligated porphyrins (Cl and NH3 ligated), as well as charged and neutral molecules, to study properties of the molecules as a function of oxidation state and local chemical environment of the Fe atom. We find that the GGA + U (with U ≈ 4 eV) approach provides a better description of the molecular electronic properties for five coordinated (FeIII) systems than the standard GGA approach, which indicates that Coulombic electron interaction effects on the Fe are important and play an essential role, particularly for the spin moment on the molecule. Also, we proceed to a larger, more realistic Fe-porphyrin model (FeP), for which we also investigate the performance of the GGA and GGA + U functionals.

	abstract = {Simultaneously predicting the geometries, spin states and binding energies of iron porphyrins using DFT methods is challenging, as one method and basis set could lead to the accurate prediction of one aspect but imprecisions on the others. In this work, six functionals and three basis sets were tested based on their description of the geometries, spin states and binding energies of an heme model. An iron porphyrin ring with an axial imidazole (FePIm) was used as the model molecule. Optimized geometries of FePIm and dioxygen-coordinated FePIm-O2 were obtained in their singlet, triplet, and quintet spin states. Energy calculations with zero-point vibrational energy (ZPVE) corrections were performed on the optimized geometries, at the same level of theory used on the geometry optimization. For the oxygen-bonded FePIm-O2, the singlet spin states were calculated to be closed-shell for all the methods, even if an unrestricted wavefunction and broken spin symmetry were imposed on the system. Consequently, the open-shell singlets were obtained using the wavefunction of their corresponding triplet states as the initial guess for the geometry optimizations and energy calculations. The functional B97D with the basis sets A (def2-TZVP on Fe, def2-SVP on other atoms) and C (6–311+G(2df) on Fe atom; 6–311+G(d) on N and O atoms; 6–31G on C and H atoms) was able to produce an accurate geometry, the correct spin states for FePIm (Quintet) and FePIm-O2 (open-shell singlet), and a binding energies of 13.51–13.07 kcal·mol−1, in good agreement to the experimental values. The basis set B resulted in good FePIm geometrical parameters with all the studied functionals, but led to significant errors in the FePIm-O2 geometries and binding energies. For the study of FePIm and similar molecules were the change of spin play a key role, the selection of constraints and initial guess are very important, as the methods could yield multiplicites which do not agree with experimental observations. This study provides valuable information for the selection of a suitable method for DFT studies on small iron porphyrins and their interaction with oxygen, based on the required accuracy for geometry, spin, or binding energies.},

Through in-situ measurements, we directly probe the charge transfer as the interfacial dipoles are formed. It is found that the\&nbsp;adsorbed molecules do not affect electron scattering rates in graphene, indicating that charge transfer is the main mechanism governing the level alignment. From the amount of transferred charge and the molecular coverage of the grown films, the amount of charge transferred per adsorbed molecule is estimated, indicating very weak interaction.},

Recently, the use of porphyrins supported on solid materials is viewed as one of the most effective strategies to obtain photocatalytic systems with superior properties and applicability. Supported porphyrins can form highly organized hybrid materials, with high electron conductivity and great photoreaction properties. Here we review concepts, development, and application of supported porphyrins/metalloporphyrins. The first sections present an overview of the water contamination problem, the fundamentals of the photocatalytic treatment of water, and the main properties of porphyrins.

GO-CONHTPP was achieved through amide formation at the periphery of GO sheets and the hybrid material was fully characterized by FTIR, XPS, Raman spectroscopy, and SEM. Spectroscopic measurements together with theoretical calculations demonstrated that assembling TPPNH $_{\textrm{2}}$ on the GO surface in DMF-H $_{\textrm{2}}$ O (1:2, v/v) via non-covalent interactions causes changes in the absorption spectra of porphyrin, as well as efficient quenching of its emission. Interestingly, covalent binding to GO does not affect notably neither the porphyrin absorption nor its fluorescence. Theoretical calculations indicates that close proximity and π–π-stacking of the porphyrin molecule with the GO sheet is possible only for the non-covalent functionalization. Femtosecond pump–probe experiments revealed that only the non-covalent assembly of TPPNH $_{\textrm{2}}$ and GO enhances the efficiency of the photoinduced electron transfer from porphyrin to GO. In contrast to the non-covalent hybrid, the covalent GO-CONHTPP material can generate singlet oxygen with quantum yields efficiency (ΦΔ = 0.20) comparable to that of free TPPNH $_{\textrm{2}}$ (ΦΔ = 0.26), indicating the possible use of covalent hybrid materials in photodynamic/photothermal therapy.

Since its debut in the mid-1990s, Siesta’s flexibility, efficiency, and free distribution have given advanced materials simulation capabilities to many groups worldwide. The core methodological scheme of Siesta combines finite-support pseudo-atomic orbitals as basis sets, norm-conserving pseudopotentials, and a real-space grid for the representation of charge density and potentials and the computation of their associated matrix elements. Here, we describe the more recent implementations on top of that core scheme, which include full spin–orbit interaction, non-repeated and multiple-contact ballistic electron transport, density functional theory (DFT)+U and hybrid functionals, time-dependent DFT, novel reduced-scaling solvers, density-functional perturbation theory, efficient van der Waals non-local density functionals, and enhanced molecular-dynamics options. In addition, a substantial effort has been made in enhancing interoperability and interfacing with other codes and utilities, such as wannier90 and the second-principles modeling it can be used for, an AiiDA plugin for workflow automatization, interface to Lua for steering Siesta runs, and various post-processing utilities. Siesta has also been engaged in the Electronic Structure Library effort from its inception, which has allowed the sharing of various low-level libraries, as well as data standards and support for them, particularly the PSeudopotential Markup Language definition and library for transferable pseudopotentials, and the interface to the ELectronic Structure Infrastructure library of solvers. Code sharing is made easier by the new open-source licensing model of the program.

	abstract = {We have investigated the atomistic structure and the electronic properties of selected metal–organic interfaces, commonly found in organic electronic devices, using ab initio simulations based on density functional theory. Our study focuses, in particular, on the interaction of a widely used p-type organic semiconductor (OS) like the [1]benzothieno[3,2-b][1]benzothiophene (BTBT) polycyclic molecule with a gold electrode, bare or functionalized with a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of aromatic thiol used as a surface modifier. A similar investigation involved an S,S’-tetraoxide derivative of BTBT indicated as BTBTOx2, showing promising characteristics as an n-type semiconductor, whose original synthetic protocol is also discussed. First, our simulations, including the ab initio calculation of dispersion forces that permits an accurate description of noncovalent interactions, show that minimal changes in local interactions can induce a different arrangement of the same molecules in contact with metal electrodes},

We report an efficient technique to dope thin-film MoS2 FETs using a poly(vinyl-alcohol) (PVA) polymeric coating. This results in a reduction of the contact resistance by up to 30\% as well as a reduction in the channel resistance to 20 kΩ sq−1. Using a dehydration process, we were able to effectively control the surface interactions between MoS2 and the more electropositive hydroxyl groups (–OH) of PVA, which provided a controllable and yet reversible increase in the charge carrier density to a value of 8.0 × 1012 cm−2. The non-covalent, thus non-destructive, PVA doping of MoS2 increases the carrier concentration without degrading the mobility, which shows a monotonic increase while enhancing the doping effect. The PVA doping technique is then exploited to create heavily doped access regions to the intrinsic MoS2 channel, which yields 200\% increase of the ON-state source–drain current. This establishes PVA doping as an effective approach to enhance the transport properties of MoS2 FETs for a variety of applications.},

We report on the self-assembly of oleylamine on top of MoS2 thin-films and the effective doping of MoS2 thin-film field effect transistors by oleylamine. Atomic force microscopy revealed that oleylamine organizes in lamellae domains on MoS2 thin films with similar characteristics of those previously observed on highly ordered pyrolytic graphite. A carrier concentration increase from 7.1 × 1011 cm−2 up to 1.9 × 1013 cm−2 at 0 V gate voltage is achieved together with a reduction of the contact resistance by a factor of 5 when using gold as metal contact. Furthermore, this non-covalent doping proves to be removable and reproducible among different flakes and does not degrade the electron mobility. Thus, this work opens the path for future works on controlling the doping of MoS2 by proper selection of the self-assembled species.},

	abstract = {The addition of molecular dopants into organic semiconductors (OSCs) is a ubiquitous augmentation strategy to enhance the electrical conductivity of OSCs. Although the importance of optimizing OSC-dopant interactions is well-recognized, chemically generalizable structure-function relationships are difficult to extract due to the sensitivity and dependence of doping efficiency on chemistry, processing conditions, and morphology. Computational modeling for an integrated OSC-dopant design is an attractive approach to systematically isolate fundamental relationships, but requires the challenging simultaneous treatment of molecular reactivity and morphology evolution. We present the first computational study to couple molecular reactivity with morphology evolution in a molecularly doped OSC. Reactive Monte Carlo is employed to examine the evolution of OSC-dopant morphologies and doping efficiency with respect to dielectric, the thermodynamic driving for the doping reaction, and dopant aggregation. We observe that for well-mixed systems with experimentally relevant dielectric constants, doping efficiency is near unity with a very weak dependence on the ionization potential and electron affinity of OSC and dopant, respectively. At experimental dielectric constants, reaction-induced aggregation is observed, corresponding to the well-known insolubility of solution-doped materials. Simulations are qualitatively consistent with a number of experimental studies showing a decrease of doping efficiency with increasing dopant concentration. Finally, we observe that the aggregation of dopants lowers doping efficiency and thus presents a rational design strategy for maximizing doping efficiency in molecularly doped OSCs. This work represents an important first step toward the systematic integration of molecular reactivity and morphology evolution into the characterization of multi-scale structure-function relationships in molecularly doped OSCs.},

Such scattering is a particular issue in two-dimensional semiconductors because charged impurities are in close proximity to the atomically thin channel. Here we report the remote modulation doping of a two-dimensional transistor that consists of a band-modulated tungsten diselenide/hexagonal boron nitride/molybdenum disulfide heterostructure. The underlying molybdenum disulfide channel is remotely doped via controlled charge transfer from dopants on the tungsten diselenide surface. The modulation-doped device exhibits two-dimensional-confined charge transport and the suppression of impurity scattering, shown by increasing mobility with decreasing temperature. Our molybdenum disulfide modulation-doped field-effect transistors exhibit a room-temperature mobility of 60 cm2 V–1 s–1; in comparison, transistors that have been directly doped exhibit a mobility of 35 cm2 V–1 s–1. Carriers in a molybdenum disulfide transistor can be modulated without decreasing mobility by remote doping and charge transfer through a van der Waals heterostructure, which avoids dopant-induced impurity scattering in the channel.},

Their two-dimensional structures and electromagnetic spectra coupled to bandgaps in the visible region indicate their suitability for digital electronics and optoelectronics. To further expand the potential applications of these two-dimensional semiconductor materials, technologies capable of precisely controlling the electrical properties of the material are essential. Doping has been traditionally used to effectively change the electrical and electronic properties of materials through relatively simple processes. To change the electrical properties, substances that can donate or remove electrons are added. Doping of atomically thin two-dimensional semiconductor materials is similar to that used for silicon but has a slightly different mechanism. Three main methods with different characteristics and slightly different principles are generally used. This review presents an overview of various advanced doping techniques based on the substitutional, chemical, and charge transfer molecular doping strategies of graphene and TMDs, which are the representative 2D semiconductor materials.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} The role of magnetism in the biological functioning of hemoglobin has been debated since its discovery by Pauling and Coryell in 1936. The hemoglobin molecule contains four heme groups each having a porphyrin layer with a Fe ion at the center. Here, we present combined density-functional theory and quantum Monte Carlo calculations for an effective model of Fe in a heme cluster. In comparison with these calculations, we analyze the experimental data on human adult hemoglobin (HbA) from the magnetic susceptibility, Mössbauer and magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) measurements. In both the deoxygenated (deoxy) and the oxygenated (oxy) cases, we show that local magnetic moments develop in the porphyrin layer with antiferromagnetic coupling to the Fe moment. Our calculations reproduce the magnetic susceptibility measurements on deoxy and oxy-HbA. For deoxy-HbA, we show that the anomalous MCD signal in the UV region is an experimental evidence for the presence of antiferromagnetic Fe-porphyrin correlations. The functional properties of hemoglobin such as the binding of O $_{\textrm{2}}$ , the Bohr effect and the cooperativity are explained based on the magnetic correlations. This analysis suggests that magnetism could be involved in the functioning of hemoglobin. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The 3d transition metal incorporated porphyrin molecules with stable paramagnetic states are one of the most explored classes of molecules for this purpose where adsorption and desorption of small gaseous molecules (e.g., CO, NO, O2) on the transition metal center show efficient control over the spin states of metalloporphyrins. However, in the present study, using on-site Coulomb interaction incorporated density functional theory (DFT + U), we demonstrate reversible spin-state switching of NO-adsorbed manganese porphyrin (MnP) on top of a gold (111) surface by inducing conformational change in the molecular geometry. In this approach, mechanical manipulation by a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) tip can reversibly interchange the binding mode of the MnNO bond between ground-state linear and metastable bent conformations. And this modification leads to spin-state switching between the low-spin state (S = 0) of the linear geometry and intermediate spin (S = 1) of the bent conformer. Further, nonequilibrium Greens function based studies reveal that, in a two-terminal device architecture, spin-polarized electronic transport through this MnP-based molecular junction can efficiently be switched off/on upon the conformational change. Thermally induced current and thermopower can also be modified distinctly when we introduce temperature bias in this nanodevice. Interestingly, precise tuning of the Fermi level of the device results in generation of pure spin thermopower, which is highly demanding for potential spin-caloritronic application.},

However, detailed insight into interaction between N-dopant and molecules at the atomic scale is currently lacking.

The transition was accompanied by an electron density redistribution within the molecule, sensed by atomic force microscopy with CO-functionalized tip. This demonstrates the unique capability of the high-resolution imaging technique to discriminate between different spin states of single molecules. Moreover, we present a method for triggering spin state transitions and tuning the electronic properties of molecules through weak non-covalent interaction with suitably functionalized graphene. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Functionalized materials consisting of inorganic substrates with organic adsorbates play an increasing role in emerging technologies like molecular electronics or hybrid photovoltaics. For such applications, the adsorption geometry of the molecules under operating conditions, e.g., ambient temperature, is crucial because it influences the electronic properties of the interface, which in turn determine the device performance. So far detailed experimental characterization of adsorbates at room temperature has mainly been done using a combination of complementary methods like photoelectron spectroscopy together with scanning tunneling microscopy. However, this approach is limited to ensembles of adsorbates. In this paper, we show that the characterization of individual molecules at room temperature, comprising the determination of the adsorption configuration and the electrostatic interaction with the surface, can be achieved experimentally by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM). We demonstrate this by identifying two different adsorption configurations of isolated copper(ii) meso-tetra (4-carboxyphenyl) porphyrin (Cu-TCPP) on rutile TiO2 (110) in ultra-high vacuum. The local contact potential difference measured by KPFM indicates an interfacial dipole due to electron transfer from the Cu-TCPP to the TiO2. The experimental results are verified by state-of-the-art first principles calculations. We note that the improvement of the AFM resolution, achieved in this work, is crucial for such accurate calculations. Therefore, high resolution AFM at room temperature is promising for significantly promoting the understanding of molecular adsorption.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We explore such a transition with a minimal electronic model comprising a Hubbard-U  on-site repulsive potential and both electron–phonon and hyperfine interactions. The model is then solved numerically for small molecules at finite temperature by Monte Carlo methods in the search for the spin crossover. This is done at the mean field level in the Hubbard-U  interaction at half filling. We demonstrate that for a certain region of the parameter space there is a spin crossover, where the system transits from a low-spin to a high-spin state as the temperature increases. In close analogy to standard spin crossover in divalent magnetic molecules such a transition is entropy driven, with both the spin and the vibrational contributions to the entropy being relevant. Such a transition is practically unaffected by the hyperfine interaction, which only plays a minor role in determining the electronic properties.},

	abstract = {[Fe(ptz)6](BF4)2 (ptz=1‐propyltetrazole) is an Fe(II) spin crossover system, which shows a light‐induced low‐spin (1A1)→high‐spin (5T2) conversion below ∼50 K by irradiating into the spin allowed 1A1→1T1 d–d absorption band. This phenomenon, known as light‐induced excited spin state trapping (LIESST), is reversible, and a subsequent irradiation into the 5T2→5E band results in a light‐induced 5T2→1A1 conversion (reverse LIESST). Single crystal absorption spectra of the title compound in the region of d–d transitions are reported. In addition to the well‐established spin allowed 1A1→1T1 and 1A1→1T2 transitions of the low‐spin species and the 5T2→5E transition of the high‐spin species two weak bands in the NIR are assigned to the spin forbidden 1A1→3T1 and 1A1→3T2 transitions. Direct irradiation into the 1A1→3T1 absorption band at 20 K results in a quantitative 1A1→5T2 conversion, proving that this low lying triplet state plays an important role in the mechanism of LIESST. A full kinetic scheme for LIESST and reverse‐LIESST with the 3T1 state as intermediate state is developed, and the quantum efficiencies for the various intersystem crossing steps involved are given: they are of the order of unity for the first step from the initially excited 1T1 and 5E states to the intermediate 3T1 state, respectively. The branching ratio from the 3T1 state to the 1A1 and the 5T2 states is 1:4.},

The molecules have been adsorbed on the bare metal surface and on an oxygen-covered surface, which shows a √2×2√2R45â̂̃ reconstruction. In order to allow for a direct comparison between magnetic moments obtained from sum-rule analysis and DFT, we calculate the spin dipolar term 7T(θ), which is also important in view of the magnetic anisotropy of the molecule. The measured x-ray magnetic circular dichroism shows a strong dependence on the photon incidence angle, which we could relate to a huge value of 7T(θ), e.g., on Cu(001), 7T(θ) amounts to -2.07 μB for normal incidence leading to a reduction of the effective spin moment (m s+7T(θ)). Calculations have also been performed to study the influence of possible ligands such as Cl and O atoms on the magnetic properties of the molecule and the interaction between molecule and surface because the experimental spectra display a clear dependence on the ligand, which is used to stabilize the molecule in the gas phase. Both types of ligands weaken the hybridization between surface and porphyrin molecule and change the magnetic spin state of the molecule, but the changes in the x-ray absorption are clearly related to residual Cl ligands. © 2013 American Physical Society.},

	abstract = {A family of five- and six-coordinated Fe-porphyrins which enable us to scrutinize the effects of non-covalent interactions on the out-of-plane displacement of iron and its spin-states and axial ligand orientation in a single distorted macrocyclic environment has been reported. Combined analysis using single-crystal X-ray structure determination and EPR spectral investigation revealed the stabilization of the high-spin state of iron in the five-coordinate complex FeIII(TPPBr8)(OCHMe2), while six-coordinate complexes [FeIII(TPPBr8)(MeOH)2]ClO4, [FeIII(TPPBr8)(H2O)2]ClO4 and [FeIII(TPPBr8)(1-MeIm)2]ClO4 stabilize admixed-high, admixed-intermediate and low-spin states, respectively. The H-bonding interactions between the weak axial H2O/MeOH and perchlorate anion resulted in an elongation of the Fe–O bond which eventually shortened the Fe–N(por) distances leading to the stabilization of the admixed spin state of iron which, otherwise, stabilizes the high-spin (S = 5/2) state only. In addition, the iron atom in [FeIII(TPPBr8)(H2O)2]ClO4 is displaced by 0.02 Å towards one of the water molecules engaged in the H-bonding interactions leading to two different Fe–O (H2O) distances of 2.098(8) and 2.122(9) Å. In contrast, iron in [FeIII(TPPBr8)(MeOH)2]ClO4 sits on the plane of the porphyrin since both the axial methanol units are engaged in similar H-bonding interactions with the ClO4− ion. Moreover, the X-ray structure of low-spin FeII(TPPBr8)(1-MeIm)2 revealed a dihedral angle of 63.0° between two imidazoles which deviates largely from the expected angle of 90° (perpendicular orientations) since the axial imidazole protons are engaged in strong intermolecular C–H⋯π interactions which thereby restrict the axial ligand movement. The complex also displays the shortest Fe–N(1-MeIm) bond along with smallest dihedral angles of 7.8° and 22.4° between the axial imidazole ring and the closest Fe–Np axis due to strong π-interactions between iron and the axial imidazole ligand. Our work highlights the influence of non-covalent interactions on the out-of-plane displacement and spin state of iron and axial ligand orientations which are indeed important steps in the functioning of various hemoproteins.},

The incorporation of organic molecules within these systems holds an immense potential, since, while nature offers a finite number of 2D materials, an almost unlimited variety of molecules can be designed and synthesized with predictable functionalities. The possibilities offered by systems in which continuous molecular layers are interfaced with inorganic 2D materials to form hybrid organic/inorganic van der Waals heterostructures are emphasized. Similar to their inorganic counterpart, the hybrid structures have been exploited to put forward novel device architectures, such as antiambipolar transistors and barristors. Moreover, specific molecular groups can be employed to modify intrinsic properties and confer new capabilities to 2D materials. In particular, it is highlighted how molecular self-assembly at the surface of 2D materials can be mastered to achieve precise control over position and density of (molecular) functional groups, paving the way for a new class of hybrid functional materials whose final properties can be selected by careful molecular design.},

	abstract = {MoS2 has attracted intense interest in many applications. Natural MoS2 and field-effect transistors made of it generally exhibit n-type characteristics, but its origin is unknown. Herein, we show that C is the origin of the universal n-type doping of natural MoS2. Photoemission spectroscopies reveal that while many MoS2 samples with C detected are n-type, some without C exhibit p-type characteristics. The C-free, p-type MoS2 changes to n-type over time with the concurrent appearance of C that is out-diffused from bulk, indicating that C induces the n-type doping. The C-origin is verified by C-deposition and supported by theoretical calculations. This carbon appears as nanometer-scale defects frequently observed in scanning tunneling microscopy. In addition, we propose, based on the calculations, that S vacancies are responsible for the p-type characteristics, which contrasts with the widespread belief. This work provides new perspectives on MoS2 doping and presents a new direction for fabricating reliable MoS2 devices.},

Semiconductor electrodes can be used in a variety of applications including liquid junction solar cells, photolytic splitting of water, pollutants and organic molecules, semiconductor processing, and sensor technology. Electrolysis of water using sunlight is extremely attractive because the hydrogen evolved can be stored more easily than either electricity or heat, and at the same time it is non-polluting, renewable, inexhaustible, and very flexible with respect to conventional fuel alternatives. An important advantage of semiconductor electrodes is that the electrochemical response can be varied extensively by simply changing impurity levels, surface treatments, or surface adsorption. Semiconductors are unique in their electronic properties due to their band structure. The electronic properties of a semiconductor are independent of crystal size. Two models can be used to explain the size quantization effect in the case of semiconductor nanoparticles. The first model is an effective mass approximation developed for relatively larger particles and the second model assumes a tight-binding framework for well-defined small clusters. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Atomically thin 2D materials such as graphene attract a lot of attention for their fascinating electrical, optical, and mechanical properties, but also for their reliability for room-temperature operations. Here, we demonstrate that thermally induced spin-state switching of spin-crossover nanoparticle thin films can be monitored through the electrical transport properties of graphene lying underneath the films. Model calculations indicate that the charge carrier scattering mechanism in graphene is sensitive to the spin-state dependence of the relative dielectric constants of the spin-crossover nanoparticles. This graphene sensor approach can be applied to a wide class of (molecular) systems with tunable electronic polarizabil},

In this paper, we report the voltage-induced switching of the high spin/low spin electronic states of spin-crossover molecules self-assembled in dense 2D networks on Au(111) and Cu(111) by scanning tunneling microscopy at low temperature. On Au(111), voltage pulses lead to the nonlocal switching of the molecules from any─high or low─spin state to the other followed by a spontaneous relaxation toward their initial state within minutes. On the other hand, on Cu(111), single molecules can be addressed at will. They retain their new electronic configuration after a voltage pulse. The memory effect demonstrated on Cu(111) is due to an interplay between long-range intermolecular interaction and molecule/substrate coupling as confirmed by mechanoelastic simulations.},

Here we introduce disordered enthalpy–entropy descriptor (DEED), a descriptor that captures the balance between entropy gains and enthalpy costs, allowing the correct classification of functional synthesizability of multicomponent ceramics, regardless of chemistry and structure. To make our calculations possible, we have developed a convolutional algorithm that drastically reduces computational resources. Moreover, DEED guides the experimental discovery of new single-phase high-entropy carbonitrides and borides.

Up to now spin manipulation has been achieved through the modification of the molecular structure either by chemical doping or by external stimuli. However, the spin of a molecule adsorbed on a surface depends primarily on the interaction between its localized orbitals and the electronic states of the substrate. Here we change the effective spin of a single molecule by modifying the molecule/metal interface in a controlled way using a low-temperature scanning tunneling microscope. A nickelocene molecule reversibly switches from a spin 1 to 1/2 when varying the electrode–electrode distance from tunnel to contact regime. This switching is experimentally evidenced by inelastic and elastic spin-flip mechanisms observed in reproducible conductance measurements and understood using first principle calculations.

Owing to their unique magnetic properties10–14, the recently reported two-dimensional magnets provide a new system for studying these features15–19.

At fixed magnetic fields near the metamagnetic transition, we realize voltage-controlled switching between antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic states. At zero magnetic field, we demonstrate a time-reversal pair of layered antiferromagnetic states that exhibit spin-layer locking, leading to a linear dependence of their MOKE signals on gate voltage with opposite slopes. Our results allow for the exploration of new magnetoelectric phenomena and van der Waals spintronics based on 2D materials.

The most active surfaces, on top of the volcano diagrams, are Mo, Fe, Rh, and Ru, but hydrogen gas formation will be a competing reaction reducing the faradaic efficiency for ammonia production. Since the early transition metal surfaces such as Sc, Y, Ti, and Zr bind N-adatoms more strongly than H-adatoms, a significant production of ammonia compared with hydrogen gas can be expected on those metal electrodes when a bias of − 1 V to − 1.5 V vs. SHE is applied. Defect-free surfaces of the early transition metals are catalytically more active than their stepped counterparts.},

Depending on the strength of the interaction of the molecules with the substrates, the spin crossover behavior can be drastically changed. Molecules in direct contact with non-magnetic metallic surfaces coexist in both the high- and low-spin states but cannot be switched between the two. Our analysis shows that this is due to a strong interaction with the substrate in the form of a chemisorption that dictates the spin state of the molecules through its adsorption geometry. Upon reducing the interaction to the surface either by adding a second molecular layer or inserting an insulating thin film of Cu2N, the spin crossover behavior is restored and molecules can be switched between the two states with the help of scanning tunneling microscopy. Especially on Cu2N, the two states of single molecules are stable at low temperature and thus allow the realization of a molecular memory. Similarly, the molecules decoupled from metallic substrates in the second or higher layers display thermally driven spin crossover as has been revealed by X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Finally, we discuss the situation when the complex is brought into contact with a ferromagnetic substrate. This leads to a strong exchange coupling between the Fe spin in the high-spin state and the magnetization of the substrate as deduced from spin-polarized scanning tunneling spectroscopy and ab initio calculation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Higher conductance is seen with [Fe\{H2B(pz)2\}2(bipy)] in the high spin state, while lower conductance occurs for the low spin state. Plausibly, there is the potential here for low-cost molecular solid-state memory because the essential molecular thin films are easily fabricated.

	abstract = {Transport of electrons in a single molecule junction is the simplest problem in the general subject area of molecular electronics. In the past few years, this area has been extended to probe beyond the simple tunnelling associated with large energy gaps between electrode Fermi level and molecular levels, to deal with smaller gaps, with near-resonance tunnelling and, particularly, with effects due to interaction of electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom. This overview is devoted to the theoretical and computational approaches that have been taken to understanding transport in molecular junctions when these vibronic interactions are involved.

 After a short experimental overview, and discussion of different test beds and measurements, we define a particular microscopic model Hamiltonian. That overall Hamiltonian can be used to discuss all of the phenomena dealt with subsequently. These include transition from coherent to incoherent transport as electron/vibration interaction increases in strength, inelastic electron tunnelling spectroscopy and its interpretation and measurement, affects of interelectronic repulsion treated at the Hubbard level, noise in molecular transport junctions, non-linear conductance phenomena, heating and heat conduction in molecular transport junctions and current-induced chemical reactions. In each of these areas, we use the same simple model Hamiltonian to analyse energetics and dynamics.

 While this overview does not attempt survey the literature exhaustively, it does provide appropriate references to the current literature (both experimental and theoretical). We also attempt to point out directions in which further research is required to answer cardinal questions concerning the behaviour and understanding of vibrational effects in molecular transport junctions.},

The study is based on a combination of first-principles electronic structure calculations to characterize the system and inelastic scattering theory to calculate transport properties. The extension of the methodology to describe hole transport through occupied molecular orbitals is discussed. The methodology is applied to molecular junctions where a benzene molecule is connected via alkanethiolate bridges to two gold electrodes. The results demonstrate that, depending on the coupling between the electronic π-system of the benzene ring and the gold electrodes, vibronic coupling may have a significant influence on the transport properties of the molecular junction.},

The understanding of the underlying mechanisms is important for the design of molecular junctions that are stable at higher bias voltages and is a prerequisite for further developments in the field of current-induced chemistry. In this work, we analyze the mechanisms of current-induced bond rupture employing a recently developed method, which combines the hierarchical equations of motion approach in twin space with the matrix product state formalism and allows accurate, fully quantum mechanical simulations of the complex bond rupture dynamics. Extending previous work [Ke et al. J. Chem. Phys. 154, 234702 (2021)], we consider specifically the effect of multiple electronic states and multiple vibrational modes. The results obtained for a series of models of increasing complexity show the importance of vibronic coupling between different electronic states of the charged molecule, which can enhance the dissociation rate at low bias voltages profoundly.},

While some of these phenomena have been observed or proposed before, the present analysis extends previous studies and allows a more detailed understanding of the underlying transport mechanisms.

When these systems interact with the electrons of the supporting substrate correlated many-particle states can emerge, making them ideal prototypical quantum systems. The spin systems, which can be constructed by arranging individual atoms on appropriate surfaces or embedded in synthesized molecular structures, can reveal very rich spectral features. Up to now the spectral complexity has only been partly described. This manuscript shows that perturbation theory enables one to describe the tunneling transport, reproducing the differential conductance with surprisingly high accuracy. Well established scattering models, which include Kondo-like spin-spin and potential interactions, are expanded to enable calculation of arbitrary complex spin systems in reasonable time scale and the extraction of important physical properties. The emergence of correlations between spins and, in particular, between the localized spins and the supporting bath electrons are discussed and related to experimentally tunable parameters. These results might stimulate new experiments by providing experimentalists with an easily applicable modeling tool.},

We show that the exact ground state energy and properties of the Hubbard dimer are reproduced by QPMP2 and demonstrate the advantages of the approach for larger Hubbard models where the metal-to-insulator transition is qualitatively reproduced, contrasting with the complete failure of traditional methods.

Recent work in transitioning classical algorithms to a quantum computer has led to great strides in improving quantum algorithms and illustrating their quantum advantage. Because of the limitations of near-term quantum computers, the most effective strategies split the work over classical and quantum computers. There is a proven set of methods in computational chemistry and materials physics that has used this same idea of splitting a complex physical system into parts that are treated at different levels of theory to obtain solutions for the complete physical system for which a brute force solution with a single method is not feasible. These methods are variously known as embedding, multi-scale, and fragment techniques and methods. We review these methods and then propose the embedding approach as a method for describing complex biochemical systems, with the parts not only treated with different levels of theory, but computed with hybrid classical and quantum algorithms. Such strategies are critical if one wants to expand the focus to biochemical molecules that contain active regions that cannot be properly explained with traditional algorithms on classical computers. While we do not solve this problem here, we provide an overview of where the field is going to enable such problems to be tackled in the future.},

A good understanding of many transport regimes in micro- and nanostructures has been established, including ballistic and diffusive transport, mode softening, or band structure engineering in phononic crystals. However, the limit of quantized transport and the engineering of single transport channels is much less explored. In this Perspective, we discuss concepts and theoretical and experimental progress in the field of quantized phonon transport in channels, such as molecular systems. We particularly highlight open questions and research opportunities that should be within experimental reach. Challenges in experimental sensitivity and control hinder fast experimental progress. Recently, however, heat transport measurements through quantum channels and single molecules have become available at room temperature using break junction techniques. These techniques are well established in the molecular electronics community and have recently been expanded to the measurement of heat transport on the single-molecule level. Given the new experimental capabilities, it is now inviting to address the rather unexplored area of molecular phonon-engineering. Several interesting theoretical predictions concern the realization of the phonon quantum interference effect, suppression of phonon current via the introduction of side groups to molecules, and the construction of a phonon diode device based on molecular anharmonicity and asymmetry. This Perspective should serve the experimental and theory community by listing key challenges, thus a roadmap for making progress in the field of quantized phonon transport.},

Here, we study resonant charge transport through graphene-based zinc-porphyrin junctions. We experimentally demonstrate an inadequacy of non-interacting Landauer theory as well as the conventional single-mode Franck–Condon model. Instead, we model overall charge transport as a sequence of non-adiabatic electron transfers, with rates depending on both outer and inner-sphere vibrational interactions. We show that the transport properties of our molecular junctions are determined by a combination of electron–electron and electron-vibrational coupling, and are sensitive to interactions with the wider local environment.

By comparing calculated results to valence-band photoelectron spectroscopy measurements, and by determining the Hubbard term from linear response, we show that the choice of U is not as straightforward and can be different for each different TMPc.

	abstract = {Abstract Electron propagator theory provides a practical means of calculating electron binding energies, Dyson orbitals, and ground-state properties from first principles. This approach to ab initio electronic structure theory also facilitates the interpretation of its quantitative predictions in terms of concepts that closely resemble those of one-electron theories. An explanation of the physical meaning of the electron propagator's poles and residues is followed by a discussion of its couplings to more complicated propagators. These relationships are exploited in superoperator theory and lead to a compact form of the electron propagator that is derived by matrix partitioning. Expressions for reference-state properties, relationships to the extended Koopmans's theorem technique for evaluating electron binding energies, and connections between Dyson orbitals and transition probabilities follow from this discussion. The inverse form of the Dyson equation for the electron propagator leads to a strategy for obtaining electron binding energies and Dyson orbitals that generalizes the HartreeÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂFock equations through the introduction of the self-energy operator. All relaxation and correlation effects reside in this operator, which has an energy-dependent, nonlocal form that is systematically improvable. Perturbative arguments produce several, convenient (e.g. partial third order, outer valence Green's function, and second-order, transition-operator) approximations for the evaluation of valence ionization energies, electron affinities, and core ionization energies. Renormalized approaches based on HartreeÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂFock or approximate Brueckner orbitals are employed when correlation effects become qualitatively important. Reference-state total energies based on contour integrals in the complex plane and gradients of electron binding energies enable exploration of final-state potential energy surfaces.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The importance of the block or band Lanczos method for many-body Green’s function calculations of atomic and molecular systems is discussed. The usual computation schemes for determining the Green’s function involve the diagonalization of Hermitian secular matrices. Considerable numerical difficulties arise, on the one hand, from the size of these matrices and, on the other hand, from the large number of eigenvalues and eigenvectors which often need to be computed in practice. In the case of the one-particle Green’s function it is shown how the computational effort of the diagonalization process can be substantially reduced using block Lanczos. The proposed procedure which consists of a block Lanczos ‘‘prediagonalization’’ and a subsequent diagonalization of the resulting smaller secular matrices quite naturally exploits the specific structure of the secular problems encountered. Its computational performance is demonstrated in a model application to the benzene molecule. The calculation of the complete valence-shell ionization spectra of the systems BeF2−4, BeF−3, and BeF2 is devised as a further application of the method in the particular case where the treatment of the full secular problem is computationally prohibitively expensive.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The weak interaction on graphene keeps a ground state configuration close to the gas phase, while the stronger interaction on gold stabilizes another electronic solution.

These molecules exhibit different energy-level alignments of the frontier molecular orbitals, thus allowing the correlation of the electronic structure and detection of vibrations.

	abstract = {Spin crossover (SCO) complexes possess a bistable spin state that reacts sensitively to changes in temperature or excitation with light. These effects have been well investigated in solids and solutions, while technological applications require the immobilization and contacting of the molecules at surfaces, which often results in the suppression of the SCO. We report on the thermal and light-induced SCO of [Fe(bpz)2phen] molecules in direct contact with a highly oriented pyrolytic graphite surface. We are able to switch on the magnetic moment of the molecules by illumination with green light at T = 6 K, and off by increasing the temperature to 65 K. The light-induced switching process is highly efficient leading to a complete spin conversion from the low-spin to the high-spin state within a submonolayer of molecules. [Fe(bpz)2phen] complexes immobilized on weakly interacting graphite substrates are thus promising candidates to realize the vision of an optically controlled molecular logic unit for spintronic d},

Utilizing single molecular magnets as their hosts establishes an interesting framework since their molecular structure is highly flexible and chemistry-based large-scale synthesis directly provides a way toward scalability. Here, we demonstrate coherent spin manipulation of single molecules on a surface, which we control individually using a scanning tunneling microscope in combination with electron spin resonance. We previously found that iron phthalocyanine (FePc) molecules form a spin-1/2 system when placed on an insulating thin film of magnesium oxide (MgO). Performing Rabi oscillation and Hahn echo measurements, we show that the FePc spin can be coherently manipulated with a phase coherence time T2Echo of several hundreds of nanoseconds. Tunneling current-dependent measurements demonstrate that interaction with the tunneling electrons is the dominating sou},

Herein, the ultimate scale limit at which cooperative spin switching becomes effective is investigated in a complex [Fe(H2B(pz)2)2(bipy)] deposited on a highly oriented pyrolytic graphite surface, using x-ray absorption spectroscopy. This system exhibits a complete thermal- and light-induced spin transition at thicknesses ranging from submonolayers to multilayers. On increasing the coverage from 0.35(4) to 10(1) monolayers, the width of the temperature-induced spin transition curve narrows significantly, evidencing the buildup of cooperative effects. While the molecules at the submonolayers exhibit an apparent anticooperative behavior, the multilayers starting from a double-layer exhibit a distinctly cooperative spin switching, with a free-molecule-like behavior indicated at around a monolayer. These observations will serve as useful guidelines in designing SCM-based devices.},

This isothermal switching is evident in thin film bilayer structures where the molecular spin crossover film is adjacent to a molecular ferroelectric. The adjacent molecular ferroelectric, either polyvinylidene fluoride hexafluoropropylene or croconic acid (C5H2O5), appears to lock the spin crossover [Fe\{H2B(pz)2\}2(bipy)] molecular complex largely in the low or high spin state depending on the direction of ferroelectric polarization. In both a planar two terminal diode structure and a transistor structure, the voltage controlled isothermal reversible spin crossover switching of [Fe\{H2B(pz)2\}2(bipy)] is accompanied by a resistance change and is seen to be nonvolatile, i.e., retained in the absence of an applied electric field. The result appears general, as the voltage controlled nonvolatile switching can be made to work with two different molecular ferroelectrics: croconic acid and polyvinylidene fluoride hexafluoropropylene.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In molecular spintronics, the goal is the development of a new generation of spintronic devices based on molecular materials or, in the longer term, on one or a few molecules. In the area of quantum technologies, the milestones reached in the design of molecular spin qubits with long quantum coherence times and in the implementation of quantum operations have raised expectations for the use of molecular spin qubits in quantum computation. MOFs and 2D materials are two classes of materials for which magnetism has been, until very recently, an elusive property; molecular materials with attractive properties and functionalities are now starting to be developed in both areas. In MOFs, single-molecule magnets and spin crossover complexes can be integrated into the nodes of the framework, within the pores or both, sometimes giving rise to smart magnetic materials or to hybrid materials exhibiting synergistic combinations of properties. 2D molecular-based magnets can provide a platform to study magnetism in the 2D limit and exhibit superior properties compared with their inorganic analogues in terms of chemical stability and tunability.},

The molecule is idealized as a two-level system with an occupied donor orbital and an empty low-lying acceptor level, and the metal as a single half-filled band. The formation of a metastable metal-to-ligand charge transfer state or negative ion resonance after electronic excitation is demonstrated. The lifetime of the negative ion resonance is determined and effective atomic charges and bond orders are computed for both the ground and the excited states. Potential energy curves and the coordinate dependence of the lifetimes are computed by varying the adsorbateÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂsurface distance, and hence the coupling strength between the molecule and the substrate. Based on a truncated Born expansion of the perturbed Green's matrix, an approximate and physically intuitive expression for the negative ion resonance width is derived and numerically justified. Variation of tight-binding parameters other than the moleculeÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂsurface coupling allows for the simulation of a broader class of substrates and adsorbates.},

This requires inexpensive and stable dyes with well-positioned frontier energy levels for maximal solar absorption, efficient charge separation, and high output voltage. Here we demonstrate an extensive computational screening of zinc porphyrins functionalized with electron donating side groups and electron accepting anchoring groups. The trends in frontier energy levels versus side groups are analyzed and a no-loss DSSC level alignment quality is estimated. Out of the initial 1029 molecules, we find around 50 candidates with level alignment qualities within 5\% of the optimal limit. We show that the level alignment of five zinc porphyrin dyes which were recently used in DSSCs with high efficiencies can be further improved by simple side group substitutions. All frontier energy levels, gaps and level alignment quality values are stored in a database publicly available.},

Three different architectures are considered: the first two involve a complex consisting of two dye molecules with appropriately matched frontier orbitals, connected by a molecular diode. Optimized combinations of dye molecules are determined by taking advantage of our computational database of the structural and energetic properties of several thousand porphyrin dyes. The third design is a molecular analogy of the intermediate band solar cell, and involves a single dye molecule with strong intersystem crossing to ensure a long lifetime of the intermediate state. Based on the calculated energy levels and molecular orbitals, energy diagrams are presented for the individual steps in the operation of such tandem solar cells. We find that theoretical open circuit voltages of up to 1.8 V can be achieved using these tandem designs. Questions about the practical implementation of prototypical devices, such as the synthesis of the tandem molecules and potential loss mechanisms, are addressed.},

Porphyrin-based dyes are characterized by strong absorption in the visible part of the spectrum and easy customization allowing their electronic properties to be controlled by structural variations. Here we present a computational screening study of more than 5000 porphyrin-based dyes obtained by modifying the porphyrin backbone (metal center and axial ligands), substituting hydrogen by fluorine, and adding different side and anchoring groups. Based on the calculated frontier orbital energies and optical gaps we quantify the energy level alignment with the TiO2 conduction band and different redox mediators. An analysis of the energy level–structure relationship reveals a significant structural diversity among the dyes with the highest level alignment quality, demonstrating the large degree of flexibility in porphyrin dye design. As a specific example of dye optimization, we show that the level alignment of the high efficiency record dye YD2-o-C8 [Yella et al., Science, 2011, 334, 629–634] can be significantly improved by modest structural variations. All the presented data have been stored in a publicly available database.},

In this paper, we use a kinetic Monte Carlo method to simulate this growth mode behavior. We present a detailed and systematic investigation into the effects of key model parameters including strain, growth temperature, and deposition rate on this phenomenon. We show that increasing the strain lowers the apparent critical thickness that is defined by the onset of 3D island formation. Similarly, increasing the growth temperature lowers the apparent critical thickness, until intermixing, and the resulting relevance of entropic contributions, become more significant. We also report the impact on Stranski–Krastanov growth of more model-specific parameters, such as bond strengths between constituent atoms of the system, and surface energy anisotropies.},

The mode Grüneisen parameter is determined from temperature dependence of each elastic constant, which is larger along the c axis than along the a axis, showing anisotropy in lattice anharmonicity. The zero-temperature elastic constants, determined using the Einstein-oscillator model, yield the Debye characteristic temperature of 636 K. The ab-initio calculation is carried out for deducing the elastic constants, and comparison between calculations and measurements at 0 K reveals that the local-density-approximation potential is preferable for theoretically evaluating characteristics of GaN.

The molecules of the membrane can be either in the low spin state (LS) or the high spin state (HS), while those of the substrate are electronically neutral. Magnetic properties of the SCO membrane and the pressure distribution as a function of the lattice parameter of the substrate have been investigated. We demonstrated that the thermally induced first-order spin transition is significantly affected by the structural properties of the substrate, where a rise in the lattice parameter of the latter lowers the transition temperature and reduces the width of the thermal hysteresis loop. The investigations on the spatiotemporal aspects of the spin transition in the membrane demonstrates that the nucleation and growth processes are sensitive to the structural properties of the elastic misfit between the substrate and the SCO membrane.},

Spin-orbit coupling in full relativistic regime together with orbital polarization correction to the exchange-correlation functional added a notable orbital contribution to magnetic moments of the individual 3d transition metals.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Non-covalent interactions pervade all matter and play a fundamental role in layered materials, biological systems, and large molecular complexes. Despite this, our accumulated understanding of non-covalent interactions to date has been mainly developed in the tens-of-atoms molecular regime. This falls considerably short of the scales at which we would like to understand energy trends, structural properties, and temperature dependencies in materials where non-covalent interactions have an appreciable role. However, as more reference information is obtained beyond moderately sized molecular systems, our understanding is improving and we stand to gain pertinent insights by tackling more complex systems, such as supramolecular complexes, molecular crystals, and other soft materials. In addition, accurate reference information is needed to provide the drive for extending the predictive power of more efficient workhorse methods, such as density functional approximations that also approximate van der Waals dispersion interactions. In this perspective, we discuss the first-principles approaches that have been used to obtain reference interaction energies for beyond modestly sized molecular complexes. The methods include quantum Monte Carlo, symmetry-adapted perturbation theory, non-canonical coupled cluster theory, and approaches based on the random-phase approximation. By considering the approximations that underpin each method, the most accurate theoretical references for supramolecular complexes and molecular crystals to date are ascertained. With these, we also assess a handful of widely used exchange-correlation functionals in density functional theory. The discussion culminates in a framework for putting into perspective the accuracy of high-level wavefunction-based methods and identifying future challenges.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The LDA+U method takes into account orbital dependence of the Coulomb and exchange interactions which is absent in the LDA. The scheme can be regarded as a `first-principles' method because there are no adjustable parameters. When applied to the transition metal and rare-earth metal compounds, the LDA+U method gives a qualitative improvement compared with the LDA not only for excited-state properties such as energy gaps but also for ground-state properties such as magnetic moments and interatomic exchange parameters. The orbital-dependent rotationally invariant LDA+U potential gives a correct orbital polarization and a corresponding Jahn - Teller distortion as well as polaron formation.},

	doi = {10.1063/1.4901238},
	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}A new approach for the calibration of (semi-)local and exact exchange-energy densities in the context of local hybrid functionals is reported. The calibration functions are derived from only the electron density and its spatial derivatives, avoiding spatial derivatives of the exact-exchange energy density or other computationally unfavorable contributions. The calibration functions fulfill the seven more important out of nine known exact constraints. It is shown that calibration improves substantially the definition of a non-dynamical correlation energy term for generalized gradient approximation (GGA)-based local hybrids. Moreover, gauge artifacts in the potential-energy curves of noble-gas dimers may be corrected by calibration. The developed calibration functions are then evaluated for a large range of energy-related properties (atomization energies, reaction barriers, ionization potentials, electron affinities, and total atomic energies) of three sets of local hybrids, using a simple one-parameter local-mixing. The functionals are based on (a) local spin-density approximation (LSDA) or (b) Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange and correlation, and on (c) Becke-88 (B88) exchange and Lee-Yang-Parr (LYP) correlation. While the uncalibrated GGA-based functionals usually provide very poor thermochemical data, calibration allows a dramatic improvement, accompanied by only a small deterioration of reaction barriers. In particular, an optimized BLYP-based local-hybrid functional has been found that is a substantial improvement over the underlying global hybrids, as well as over previously reported LSDA-based local hybrids. It is expected that the present calibration approach will pave the way towards new generations of more accurate hyper-GGA functionals based on a local mixing of exchange-energy densities.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Ground-state properties of solids have been extensively investigated for several decades within the standard density functional theory. Excited-state properties, on the other hand, were relatively unexplored in ab initio calculations until a decade ago. The most suitable approach up to now for studying excited-state properties of extended systems is the Green function method. To calculate the Green function one requires the self-energy operator which is non-local and energy dependent. In this article we describe the GW approximation which has turned out to be a fruitful approximation to the self-energy. The Green function theory, numerical methods for carrying out the self-energy calculations, simplified schemes, and applications to various systems are described. Self-consistency issue and new developments beyond the GW approximation are also discussed as well as the success and shortcomings of the GW approximation.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Spin-transition materials, including the families of spin-crossover and charge-transfer systems, and more generally molecular-based materials exhibiting electronic and/or structural bistability, may undergo various types of phase transitions. The change of electronic state is stabilized by molecular reorganizations and both phenomena, which are usually non-symmetry breaking, can be described through the evolution of an order parameter q. Due to symmetry, q linearly couples to volume change. It is known that such elastic interactions are responsible for cooperative phenomena in non-symmetry-breaking spin-transitions. However, spin-transition materials may also exhibit symmetry-breaking phenomena related to various types of orders such as structural order as well as spin-state concentration waves. The universal framework of the Landau theory of phase transition is relevant for describing such ordering processes through the evolution of a symmetry-breaking order parameter η. The simultaneous or sequential occurrence of spin-transition and symmetry-breaking phenomena are reported for numerous spin-transition materials, and the coupling between these two types of instabilities is responsible for the emergence of various types of functions. In this work, we use the Landau approach to describe both symmetry-breaking phenomena and non-symmetry-breaking spin transition. We discuss how their coupling can generate sequences of phase transitions, from simple spin-crossover to spin-transition, continuous or discontinuous symmetry breaking, including ferroelasticity or stepwise spin transitions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The strong SOC tends to stabilize planar structures for n = 2–5, whereas for clusters consisting of six atoms,three-dimensional structures remain preferred. SOC leads to the formation of large orbital magnetic moments and to a mixing of different spin states. Due to the spin-mixing the total magnetic moment may be larger or smaller than the spin moment in the absence of SOC. Both spin and orbital moments are found to be anisotropic. Because of the strong SOCthe energy differences between coexisting magnetic isomers can be comparable to or even smaller than their magnetic anisotropy energies. In this case the lowest barrier for magnetization reversal can be determined by a magnetic isomer which is different from the ground state configuration.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

To do so, we developed and validated a force field that reliably models the modes of coordination bonds via a Morse potential functional form and employs cationic and anionic dummy atoms to capture coordination symmetry. We also explored a set of physically relevant collective variables and carefully selected an appropriate subset for our problem at hand. After a rapid increase of the Zn–N connectivity, we observe the evaporation of small clusters in favor of a few large clusters, which leads to the formation of an amorphous highly connected aggregate. Zn(MIm)42− and Zn(MIm)3− complexes are observed with lifetimes in the order of a few picoseconds, while larger structures, such as four-, five-, and six-membered rings, have substantially longer lifetimes of a few nanoseconds. The free ligands act as “templating agents” for the formation of sodalite cages. ZIF-8 crystal decomposition results in the formation of a vitreous phase. Our findings contribute to a fundamental understanding of MOF’s synthesis that paves the way to controlling synthesis products. Furthermore, our developed force field and methodology can be applied to model solution processes that require coordination bond reactivity for other ZIFs besides ZIF-8.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

To continue to progress toward the quality of results demanded by today’s ab initio quantum chemistry encourages a new direction. We believe ab initio DFT is a promising route to pursue. Whereas conventional DFT cannot describe weak interactions, photoelectron spectra, or many potential energy surfaces, ab initio DFT, even in its initial, optimized effective potential, second-order many-body perturbation theory form [OEP (2)-semi canonical], is shown to do all well. In fact, we obtain accuracy that frequently exceeds MP2, being competitive with coupled-cluster theory in some cases. Furthermore, this is accomplished within a relatively fast computational procedure that scales like iterative second order. We illustrate our results with several molecular examples including Ne2,Be2,F2, and benzene.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Additionally, they predict optimized geometries that are nearly free of basis set superposition error that lead to improved estimates of spectroscopic properties. Taking advantage of the local correlation energy partitioning scheme, we compare the different interaction environments present in small clusters and those inside the 51262 clathrate cage.

Strong quantum confinement increases the gap of GaN to as high as 5.44 eV and enables light emission in the deep-UV range. Luminescence occurs from the heavy and light hole bands of GaN yielding E ⊥ c polarized light emission. Strong confinement also increases the exciton binding energy up to 230 meV, preventing a thermal dissociation of excitons at room temperature. However, we did not observe excitons experimentally due to high excited free-carrier concentrations. Monolayer-thick GaN wells also exhibit a large electron-hole wave function overlap and negligible Stark shift, which is expected to enhance the radiative recombination efficiency. Our results indicate that atomically thin GaN/AlN heterostructures are promising for efficient deep-UV optoelectronic devices.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The rise of KS-DFT in chemical physics began in earnest in the mid 1980s, when crucial developments in its exchange-correlation term gave the theory predictive power competitive with well-developed wave-function methods. Today KS-DFT finds itself under increasing pressure to deliver higher and higher accuracy and to adapt to ever more challenging problems. If we are not mindful, however, these pressures may submerge the theory in the wave-function sea. KS-DFT might be lost.

In order to keep up with state-of-the-art experiments and the ever growing complexity of the investigated problems, there is a constantly increasing need for simulations of more realistic, i.e., larger, model systems with improved accuracy. In many cases, the availability of sufficiently efficient interatomic potentials providing reliable energies and forces has become a serious bottleneck for performing these simulations. To address this problem, currently a paradigm change is taking place in the development of interatomic potentials. Since the early days of computer simulations simplified potentials have been derived using physical approximations whenever the direct application of electronic structure methods has been too demanding. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) now offer an alternative approach for the representation of potential-energy surfaces by fitting large data sets from electronic structure calculations. In this perspective, the central ideas underlying these ML potentials, solved problems and remaining challenges are reviewed along with a discussion of their current applicability and limitations.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Ab initio, electronic energy bands of MoS2 single layer are reported within the local density functional approximation. The inclusion of spin orbit coupling reveals the presence of two excitons A and B. We also discuss the change of physical properties of MoS2 from multilayer and bulk counterparts. The nature of the band gap changes from indirect to direct when the thickness is reduced to a single monolayer. The imaginary and real dielectric functions are investigated. Refractive index and birefringence are also reported. The results suggest that MoS2 is suitable for potential applications in optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices. The ab initio study is essential to propose the crucial parameters for the analytical model used for A-B exciton properties of the monolayer MoS2. From a theoretical point of view, we consider how the exciton behavior evolves under environmental dielectrics.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}2D III‐nitride materials have been receiving considerable attention recently due to their excellent physicochemical properties, such as high stability, wide and tunable bandgap, and magnetism. Therefore, 2D III‐nitride materials can be applied in various fields, such as electronic and photoelectric devices, spin‐based devices, and gas detectors. Although the developments of 2D h‐BN materials have been successful, the fabrication of other 2D III‐nitride materials, such as 2D h‐AlN, h‐GaN, and h‐InN, are still far from satisfactory, which limits the practical applications of these materials. In this review, recent advances in the properties, growth methods, and potential applications of 2D III‐nitride materials are summarized. The properties of the 2D III‐nitride materials are mainly obtained by first‐principles calculations because of the difficulties in the growth and characterizations of these materials. The discussion on the growth of 2D III‐nitride materials is focused on 2D h‐BN and h‐AlN, as the developments of 2D h‐GaN and h‐InN are yet to be realized. Therefore, applications have been realized mostly based on the 2D h‐BN materials; however, many potential applications are cited for the entire range of 2D III‐nitride materials. Finally, future research directions and prospects in this field are also discussed.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Direct random phase approximation (RPA) correlation energies have become increasingly popular as a post-Kohn-Sham correction, due to significant improvements over DFT calculations for properties such as long-range dispersion effects, which are problematic in conventional density functional theory. On the other hand, RPA still has various weaknesses, such as unsatisfactory results for non-isogyric processes. This can in parts be attributed to the self-correlation present in RPA correlation energies, leading to significant self-interaction errors. Therefore a variety of schemes have been devised to include exchange in the calculation of RPA correlation energies in order to correct this shortcoming. One of the most popular RPA plus exchange schemes is the second order screened exchange (SOSEX) correction. RPA + SOSEX delivers more accurate absolute correlation energies and also improves upon RPA for non-isogyric processes. On the other hand, RPA + SOSEX barrier heights are worse than those obtained from plain RPA calculations. To combine the benefits of RPA correlation energies and the SOSEX correction, we introduce a short-range RPA + SOSEX correction. Proof of concept calculations and benchmarks showing the advantages of our method are presented.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The detailed description of the underlying algorithm is provided, including approximations used that preserve the pole structure of the full GFCCSD method, thereby reducing the computational costs while maintaining an accurate character of methodology.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The WIEN2k program is based on the augmented plane wave plus local orbitals (APW+lo) method to solve the Kohn–Sham equations of density functional theory. The APW+lo method, which considers all electrons (core and valence) self-consistently in a full-potential treatment, is implemented very efficiently in WIEN2k, since various types of parallelization are available and many optimized numerical libraries can be used. Many properties can be calculated, ranging from the basic ones, such as the electronic band structure or the optimized atomic structure, to more specialized ones such as the nuclear magnetic resonance shielding tensor or the electric polarization. After a brief presentation of the APW+lo method, we review the usage, capabilities, and features of WIEN2k (version 19) in detail. The various options, properties, and available approximations for the exchange-correlation functional, as well as the external libraries or programs that can be used with WIEN2k, are mentioned. References to relevant applications and some examples are also given.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}We revisit the Hartree-Fock (HF) calculation for the uniform electron gas, or jellium model, whose predictions—divergent derivative of the energy dispersion relation and vanishing density of states (DOS) at the Fermi level—are in qualitative disagreement with experimental evidence for simple metals. Currently, this qualitative failure is attributed to the lack of screening in the HF equations. Employing Slater’s hyper-Hartree-Fock (HHF) equations, derived variationally, to study the ground state and the excited states of jellium, we find that the divergent derivative of the energy dispersion relation and the zero in the DOS are still present, but shifted from the Fermi wavevector and energy of jellium to the boundary between the set of variationally optimised and unoptimised HHF orbitals. The location of this boundary is not fixed, but it can be chosen to lie at arbitrarily high values of wavevector and energy, well clear from the Fermi level of jellium. We conclude that, rather than the lack of screening in the HF equations, the well-known qualitative failure of the ground-state HF approximation is an artifact of its nonlocal exchange operator. Other similar artifacts of the HF nonlocal exchange operator, not associated with the lack of electronic correlation, are known in the literature.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}We study within the GW and Bethe-Salpeter many-body perturbation theories the electronic and optical properties of small (H2O)n water clusters (n = 1-6). Comparison with high-level CCSD(T) Coupled-Cluster at the Single Double (Triple) levels and ADC(3) Green’s function third order algebraic diagrammatic construction calculations indicates that the standard non-self-consistent G0W0@PBE or G0W0@PBE0 approaches significantly underestimate the ionization energy by about 1.1 eV and 0.5 eV, respectively. Consequently, the related Bethe-Salpeter lowest optical excitations are found to be located much too low in energy when building transitions from a non-self-consistent G0W0 description of the quasiparticle spectrum. Simple self-consistent schemes, with update of the eigenvalues only, are shown to provide a weak dependence on the Kohn-Sham starting point and a much better agreement with reference calculations. The present findings rationalize the theory to experiment possible discrepancies observed in previous G0W0 and Bethe-Salpeter studies of bulk water. The increase of the optical gap with increasing cluster size is consistent with the evolution from gas to dense ice or water phases and results from an enhanced screening of the electron-hole interaction.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We performed an exact treatment within the framework of the well known transfer matrix method and derived the thermal evolution of the high spin fraction, the correlation function and the heat capacity. We show that a model of competition of the interactions between similar spin state ions reproduces qualitatively the main features of experimental data: gradual, abrupt and two-step spin crossover transitions. In addition, we found that the intermediate region of the two-step transition exhibits two types of spatial organization, according to the sign of the interactions. Indeed, antiferro-like and ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂantiphaseÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ (called the phase in the ANNNI model) structures are obtained. We also found that these two configurations can be distinguished through the thermal evolution of their corresponding correlation functions.

The existence of the phase , predicted by the present model, is in good agreement with recent observations on a spin crossover sample of [Fe(CNBH3)(4phpy)2(ÃÂÃÂ¼-bpypz)2] for which this phase was evidenced for the first time, in these materials.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Reports published in the last 25 years on the synthesis of carbon-based materials significantly superior to diamond in hardness and elastic properties have been critically examined, and three groups of recently appearing myths have been analyzed. The first group concerns the possibility of producing materials with bulk moduli much higher than that of diamond. The second group concerns the “experimentally measured” hardness, which is significantly higher than that of diamond. Myths of the third group state that quantum confinement effects supposedly provide “theoretical” foundations for a several-fold increase in the hardness of covalent materials. The fundamental impossibility of synthesizing materials with elastic moduli noticeably exceeding those of diamond under normal conditions has been demonstrated. The problems relating to measuring hardness have been discussed; it was shown that the formation of obstacles for the motion of dislocations can allow an increase of the measured hardness of superhard materials by 20\%–40\%. It was demonstrated that other hypothetical ways for hardness increase, e.g., owing to quantum confinement, have no real physical grounds. The superior mechanical properties of diamond are due to reliably established physical laws. Accordingly, any statements on the possibility of obtaining materials with elastic characteristics and/or hardness several times higher than the corresponding values for diamond cannot be considered as scientifically reliable.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We investigated the ultrafast formation of the lowest quintet state of aqueous iron(II) tris(bipyridine) upon excitation of the singlet metal-to-ligand-charge-transfer ( $^{\textrm{1}}$ MLCT) state by femtosecond optical pump/x-ray probe techniques based on x-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES). By recording the intensity of a characteristic XANES feature as a function of laser pump/x-ray probe time delay, we find that the quintet state is populated in about 150 femtoseconds. The quintet state is further evidenced by its full XANES spectrum recorded at a 300-femtosecond time delay. These results resolve a long-standing issue about the population mechanism of quintet states in iron(II)-based complexes, which we identify as a simple $^{\textrm{1}}$ MLCT→ $^{\textrm{3}}$ MLCT→ $^{\textrm{5}}$ T cascade from the initially excited state. The time scale of the $^{\textrm{3}}$ MLCT→ $^{\textrm{5}}$ T relaxation corresponds to the period of the iron-nitrogen stretch vibration. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

A significant focus of the last decade’s research in this field has been 2D semiconductors, whose electronic properties can be tuned through manipulation of dimensionality, substrate engineering, strain, and doping (Mak et al 2010 Phys. Rev. Lett. 105 136805; Zhang et al 2017 Sci. Rep. 7 16938; Conley et al 2013 Nano Lett. 13 3626–30; Li et al 2016 Adv.

Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and tungsten diselenide (WSe2) have dominated recent interest for potential integration in electronic technologies, due to their intrinsic and tunable properties, atomic-scale thicknesses, and relative ease of stacking to create new and custom structures. However, to go ‘beyond the bench’, advances in large-scale, 2D layer synthesis and engineering must lead to ‘exfoliation-quality’ 2D layers at the wafer scale. This roadmap aims to address this grand challenge by identifying key technology drivers where 2D layers can have an impact, and to discuss synthesis and layer engineering for the realization of electronic-grade, 2D materials. We focus on three fundamental areas of research that must be heavily pursued in both experiment and computation to achieve high-quality materials for electronic and optoelectronic applications.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Last year, at least 30,000 scientific papers used the Kohn–Sham scheme of density functional theory to solve electronic structure problems in a wide variety of scientific fields. Machine learning holds the promise of learning the energy functional via examples, bypassing the need to solve the Kohn–Sham equations. This should yield substantial savings in computer time, allowing larger systems and/or longer time-scales to be tackled, but attempts to machine-learn this functional have been limited by the need to find its derivative. The present work overcomes this difficulty by directly learning the density-potential and energy-density maps for test systems and various molecules. We perform the first molecular dynamics simulation with a machine-learned density functional on malonaldehyde and are able to capture the intramolecular proton transfer process. Learning density models now allows the construction of accurate density functionals for realistic molecular systems.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {We summarize the molgw code that implements density-functional theory and many-body perturbation theory in a Gaussian basis set. The code is dedicated to the calculation of the many-body self-energy within the GW approximation and the solution of the Bethe–Salpeter equation. These two types of calculations allow the user to evaluate physical quantities that can be compared to spectroscopic experiments. Quasiparticle energies, obtained through the calculation of the GW self-energy, can be compared to photoemission or transport experiments, and neutral excitation energies and oscillator strengths, obtained via solution of the Bethe–Salpeter equation, are measurable by optical absorption. The implementation choices outlined here have aimed at the accuracy and robustness of calculated quantities with respect to measurements. Furthermore, the algorithms implemented in molgw allow users to consider molecules or clusters containing up to 100 atoms with rather accurate basis sets, and to choose whether or not to apply the resolution-of-the-identity approximation. Finally, we demonstrate the parallelization efficacy of the molgw code over several hundreds of processors.

We find that the fundamental bandgap is indirect with a value of 2.049 eV, while the minimum direct gap has a value of 4.135 eV. We calculate the carrier effective masses and report smaller values for the holes than the electrons, indicating higher hole mobility and easier p-type doping. The small difference between the static and high frequency dielectric constants indicates that BAs is only weakly ionic. We also observe that the imaginary part of the dielectric function exhibits a strong absorption peak, which corresponds to parallel bands in the band structure. Our estimated exciton binding energy of 43 meV indicates that excitons are relatively stable against thermal dissociation at room temperature. Our work provides theoretical insights into the fundamental electronic properties of BAs to guide experimental characterization and device applications.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We chose high-entropy transition-metal carbides because of their exceptional thermal, chemical stability, and mechanical properties. By integrating computational thermodynamic disorder modeling and time-dependent density functional theory characterization, we discovered a crossover energy in the infrared and visible range, corresponding to a metal-to-dielectric transition, exploitable for plasmonics. It was also found that the optical response of high-entropy carbides can be largely tuned from the near-IR to visible when changing the transition metal components and their concentration. By monitoring the electronic structures, we suggest rules for optimizing optical properties and designing tailored high-entropy ceramics. Experiments performed on the archetype carbide HfTa $_{\textrm{4}}$ C $_{\textrm{5}}$ yielded plasmonic properties from room temperature to 1500K. Here we propose plasmonic transition-metal high-entropy carbides as a class of multifunctional materials. Their combination of plasmonic activity, high-hardness, and extraordinary thermal stability will result in yet unexplored applications. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	doi = {10.1063/1.5055860},
	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}We introduce the concept of a probabilistic or p-bit, intermediate between the standard bits of digital electronics and the emerging q-bits of quantum computing. We show that low barrier magnets or LBMs provide a natural physical representation for p-bits and can be built either from perpendicular magnets designed to be close to the in-plane transition or from circular in-plane magnets. Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) built using LBMs as free layers can be combined with standard NMOS transistors to provide three-terminal building blocks for large scale probabilistic circuits that can be designed to perform useful functions. Interestingly, this three-terminal unit looks just like the 1T/MTJ device used in embedded magnetic random access memory technology, with only one difference: the use of an LBM for the MTJ free layer. We hope that the concept of p-bits and p-circuits will help open up new application spaces for this emerging technology. However, a p-bit need not involve an MTJ; any fluctuating resistor could be combined with a transistor to implement it, while completely digital implementations using conventional CMOS technology are also possible. The p-bit also provides a conceptual bridge between two active but disjoint fields of research, namely, stochastic machine learning and quantum computing. First, there are the applications that are based on the similarity of a p-bit to the binary stochastic neuron (BSN), a well-known concept in machine learning. Three-terminal p-bits could provide an efficient hardware accelerator for the BSN. Second, there are the applications that are based on the p-bit being like a poor man's q-bit. Initial demonstrations based on full SPICE simulations show that several optimization problems, including quantum annealing are amenable to p-bit implementations which can be scaled up at room temperature using existing technology.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

To date, three computational chemistry software formats are supported (Gaussian, GAMESS, and NWChem). Some key features are: gas-phase molecular thermodynamic properties (offering hindered rotor treatment), thermal equilibrium constants, transition state theory rate coefficients (transition state theory (TST), variational transition state theory (VTST)) including one-dimensional (1D) tunnelling effects (Wigner, and Eckart) and Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus (RRKM) rate constants, for elementary reactions with well-defined barriers. KiSThelP is intended as a working tool both for the general public and also for more expert users. It provides graphical front-end capabilities designed to facilitate calculations and interpreting results. KiSThelP enables to change input data and simulation parameters directly through the graphical user interface and to visually probe how it affects results. Users can access results in the form of graphs and tables. The graphical tool offers customizing of 2D plots, exporting images and data files. These features make this program also well-suited to support and enhance students learning and can serve as a very attractive courseware, taking the teaching content directly from results in molecular and kinetic modelling.

We describe systems composed of individual magnetic atoms, metal‐organic networks, metal wires, and bimetallic particles, as well as strategies to control their magnetic moment, anisotropy, and temperature‐dependent magnetic behavior.

We derive analytical formulas based on a dipole–dipole model, and show that the non-radiative decay rate follows a R−6 dependence at short distance, where R is the distance between the emitter and the center of the nanoparticle, as in Förster’s energy transfer. The distance dependence of the radiative decay rate is more subtle. It is chiefly dominated by a R−3 dependence, a R−6 dependence being visible at plasmon resonance. The latter is a consequence of radiative damping in the effective dipole polarizability of the nanoparticle. The different distance behavior of the radiative and non-radiative decay rates implies that the apparent quantum yield always vanishes at short distance. Moreover, non-radiative decay is strongly enhanced when the emitter radiates at the plasmon-resonance frequency of the nanoparticle.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Automated analyses of the outcome of a simulation have been an important part of atomistic modeling since the early days, addressing the need of linking the behavior of individual atoms and the collective properties that are usually the final quantity of interest. Methods such as clustering and dimensionality reduction have been used to provide a simplified, coarse-grained representation of the structure and dynamics of complex systems from proteins to nanoparticles. In recent years, the rise of machine learning has led to an even more widespread use of these algorithms in atomistic modeling and to consider different classification and inference techniques as part of a coherent toolbox of data-driven approaches. This perspective briefly reviews some of the unsupervised machine-learning methods—that are geared toward classification and coarse-graining of molecular simulations—seen in relation to the fundamental mathematical concepts that underlie all machine-learning techniques. It discusses the importance of using concise yet complete representations of atomic structures as the starting point of the analyses and highlights the risk of introducing preconceived biases when using machine learning to rationalize and understand structure-property relations. Supervised machine-learning techniques that explicitly attempt to predict the properties of a material given its structure are less susceptible to such biases. Current developments in the field suggest that using these two classes of approaches side-by-side and in a fully integrated mode, while keeping in mind the relations between the data analysis framework and the fundamental physical principles, will be key to realizing the full potential of machine learning to help understand the behavior of complex molecules and materials.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Despite its versatility, routine DFT calculations are usually limited to a few hundred atoms due to the computational bottleneck posed by the KS equation. Here we introduce a machine-learning-based scheme to efficiently assimilate the function of the KS equation, and by-pass it to directly, rapidly, and accurately predict the electronic structure of a material or a molecule, given just its atomic configuration. A new rotationally invariant representation is utilized to map the atomic environment around a grid-point to the electron density and local density of states at that grid-point. This mapping is learned using a neural network trained on previously generated reference DFT results at millions of grid-points. The proposed paradigm allows for the high-fidelity emulation of KS DFT, but orders of magnitude faster than the direct solution. Moreover, the machine learning prediction scheme is strictly linear-scaling with system size.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Phys. 141, 064111 (2014)] based on nonequilibrium Green’s function techniques to study the effects of electron correlation on the charge transport process in molecular junctions. In this formalism, the single-impurity Anderson’s model is used as the zeroth-order Hamiltonian of each channel orbital, and the inter-channel interactions are treated by perturbation corrections. Within this scheme, the on-channel Coulomb repulsion and the single-particle spectral line-broadening can be incorporated in the zeroth-order approximation, and thus the Coulomb blockade and coherent tunneling through individual channels can be described properly. Beyond the zeroth-order description, electron correlation can be included through the self-energy corrections in the forms of the second-Born approximation and the GW approximation. The effects of electron correlation on molecular junctions are manifested as the orbital energy correction, correlated transport process, and collisional line-broadening. As an application, we have applied the present formalism to phenyl-based molecular junctions described by the Pariser-Parr-Pople Hamiltonian. The signatures of electron correlation in the simulated current-voltage curves are identified and discussed.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The Hamiltonian parameters are fit to best match the ab initio two-body density matrices and energies of the ground and excited states, and thus we refer to the method as ab initio density matrix based downfolding. For benzene (a finite system), we find good agreement with experimentally available energy gaps without using any experimental inputs. For graphene, a two dimensional solid (extended system) with periodic boundary conditions, we find the effective on-site Hubbard U∗/t to be 1.3 ± 0.2, comparable to a recent estimate based on the constrained random phase approximation. For molecules, such parameterizations enable calculation of excited states that are usually not accessible within ground state approaches. For solids, the effective Hamiltonian enables large-scale calculations using techniques designed for lattice models.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Modern semiconductor technology can trace its origins to the invention of the point contact transistor in 1947. This demonstration paved the way for the development of discrete and integrated semiconductor devices and circuits that has helped to build a modern society where semiconductors are ubiquitous components of everyday life. A key property that determines the semiconductor electrical and optical properties is the bandgap. Beyond graphene, recently discovered two-dimensional (2D) materials possess semiconducting bandgaps ranging from the terahertz and mid-infrared in bilayer graphene and black phosphorus, visible in transition metal dichalcogenides, to the ultraviolet in hexagonal boron nitride. In particular, these 2D materials were demonstrated to exhibit highly tunable bandgaps, achieved via the control of layers number, heterostructuring, strain engineering, chemical doping, alloying, intercalation, substrate engineering, as well as an external electric field. We provide a review of the basic physical principles of these various techniques on the engineering of quasi-particle and optical bandgaps, their bandgap tunability, potentials and limitations in practical realization in future 2D device technologies.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Among many potential candidates, low cost and earth abundant transition metal dichalcogenides such as MoS2 and WS2 have been promising as good H2 evolution electrocatalysts when they are engineered into the structures with active sites. In this work, we have performed systematic studies on the catalytic reactivity of both MoS2 and WS2 materials produced by one-step and scalable thermolysis from (NH4)2WS4 and (NH4)2MoS4 precursors respectively. Structural analysis shows that these materials prepared at a higher thermolysis temperature exhibit higher crystallinity. The H2 evolution electrocatalysts efficiency for the MoS2 prepared at a lower temperature is higher than those at higher temperatures, where amorphous MoS2 or S22ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ species instead of crystalline MoS2 is the main active site. By contrast, crystalline WS2 prepared at high temperature is identified to be the key reaction site. Both catalysts display excellent efficiency and durability as an electrocatalyst operating in acidic electrolytes. This work provides fundamental insights for further design and preparation of emergent metal dichalcogenide catalysts, beneficial for the development in clean energy.},

Prediction errors for corresponding properties, atomic forces, and dipole moments improve in a systematic fashion with training set size and reach high accuracy for small training sets.

The shallow donor bound exciton dissociation at low temperatures (T ≤ 50 K) is found to be dominated by the release of a free exciton with thermal activation energy consistent with the exciton localization energy. At higher temperatures a second dissociation channel with activation energy E $_{\textrm{A}}$ = 28 ± 2 meV is observed. The dissociation of a bound exciton complex with exciton localization energy E $^{\textrm{X}}$ $_{\textrm{loc}}$ = 11.7 meV is also dominated by the release of a free exciton. In contrast to previous studies evidence is presented against the hypothesis of this emission being due to the exciton bound to an ionized donor.

Here, we employ synchrotron Mössbauer spectroscopy to investigate a monolayer of a tetrairon(III) (Fe $_{\textrm{4}}$ ) SMM chemically grafted on a gold substrate. At low temperature and zero magnetic field, we observe the magnetic pattern of the Fe $_{\textrm{4}}$ molecule, indicating slow spin fluctuations compared to the Mössbauer timescale. Significant structural deformations of the magnetic core, induced by the interaction with the substrate, as predicted by ab initio molecular dynamics, are also observed. However, the effects of the modifications occurring at the individual iron sites partially compensate each other, so that slow magnetic relaxation is retained on the surface. Interestingly, these deformations escaped detection by conventional synchrotron-based techniques, like X-ray magnetic circular dichroism, thus highlighting the power of synchrotron Mössbauer spectroscopy for the investigation of hybrid interfaces. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Based on a perturbationlike theory, the spin-dependent pseudopotentials have been shown to accurately reproduce properties of transition metal atoms and bulk crystals within real space DFT formalisms. In the present paper, we revisit the question of the transferability of pseudopotentials for the study of transition elements and implement the spin-dependent pseudopotentials in the more standard approach to condensed matter DFT calculations—namely, the plane-wave pseudopotential DFT method. Applications to bulk Ni, Fe, and Cr and comparison with other pseudopotential methods show that the method promises to provide an enhancement of the pseudopotential transferability compared to the standard norm-conserving or ultrasoft pseudopotentials, even beyond the nonlinear core correction.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Such fractional-spin states are shown to be ensembles of degenerate ground states with normal spins. It is proven here that the energy of the exact functional for fractional-spin states is a constant, equal to the energy of the comprising degenerate pure-spin states. Dramatic deviations from this exact constancy condition exist with all approximate functionals, leading to large static correlation errors for strongly correlated systems, such as chemical bond dissociation and band structure of Mott insulators. This is demonstrated with numerical calculations for several molecular systems. Approximating the constancy behavior for fractional spins should be a major aim in functional constructions and should open the frontier for density functional theory to describe strongly correlated systems. The key results are also shown to apply in reduced density-matrix functional theory.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

It is analysed that these absorption systems are of not only high chemical stabilities but also much enhanced magnetic anisotropies and particularly the easy magnetization axis is changed from the in-plane one for Mn to the out-of-plane one for Fe by a symmetry-lowering Jahn-Teller distortion.

The temperature- and exposure-dependent growth of graphene is investigated in detail by scanning tunneling microscopy. TPG is found to yield compact graphene islands bounded by C zigzag edges. The island size may be tuned from a few to a couple of tens of nanometers through Smoluchowski ripening. In the CVD growth, the carbon in ethene molecules arriving on the Ir surface is found to convert with probability near unity to graphene. The temperature-dependent nucleation, interaction with steps and coalescence of graphene islands are analyzed and a consistent model for CVD growth is developed.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Further, the study of thermal and thermoelectric phenomena in molecular junctions provides novel insights into the limits of applicability of classical laws. Here, we present a review of the computational and experimental progress made in probing thermoelectric effects, thermal conduction, heat dissipation, and local heating/cooling in self-assembled monolayer and single molecule junctions.

These ECPs are consistent not only within the lanthanide series, but also with the third-row transition metals which bracket them. A 46-electron core was chosen to provide the best compromise between computational savings and chemical accuracy. Thus, the 5s and 5p are included as ‘‘outer’’ core while all lower energy atomic orbitals (AOs) are replaced with the ECP. Generator states were chosen from the most chemically relevant +3 and +2 oxidation states. The results of atomic calculations indicate that the greatest error vs highly accurate numerical potential/large, even-tempered basis set calculations results from replacement of the large, even-tempered basis sets with more compact representations. However, the agreement among atomic calculations remains excellent with both basis set sizes, for a variety of spin and oxidation states, with a significant savings in time for the optimized valence basis set. It is expected that the compact representation of the ECPs and valence basis sets will eventually encourage their use by computational chemists to further explore the bonding and reactivity of lanthanide complexes.  {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}A wide variety of experimental results and theoretical investigations in recent years have convincingly demonstrated that several transition metal oxides and other materials have dominant states that are not spatially homogeneous. This occurs in cases in which several physical interactions—spin, charge, lattice, and/or orbital—are simultaneously active. This phenomenon causes interesting effects, such as colossal magnetoresistance, and it also appears crucial to understand the high-temperature superconductors. The spontaneous emergence of electronic nanometer-scale structures in transition metal oxides, and the existence of many competing states, are properties often associated with complex matter where nonlinearities dominate, such as soft materials and biological systems. This electronic complexity could have potential consequences for applications of correlated electronic materials, because not only charge (semiconducting electronic), or charge and spin (spintronics) are of relevance, but in addition the lattice and orbital degrees of freedom are active, leading to giant responses to small perturbations. Moreover, several metallic and insulating phases compete, increasing the potential for novel behavior.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

As a further consequence, the kinetic and potential energies agree with the virial theorem, and the many possible methods for calculating the total energy all give the same result. In these calculations we use the finite temperature formalism and calculate the Green’s function on the imaginary time axis. This allows for a simple extension to nonequilibrium systems.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The presence of a high density of excited electronic states in the immediate vicinity of the optically bright state of a molecule paves the way for numerous photo-relaxation channels. In transition-metal complexes, the presence of heavy atoms results in a stronger spin–orbit coupling, which enables spin forbidden spin-crossover processes to compete with the spin-allowed internal conversion processes. However, no matter how effectively the states cross around the Franck–Condon region, the degree of vibronic coupling, of both relativistic and non-relativistic nature, drives the population distribution among these states. One such case is demonstrated in this work for the intermediate-spin Fe(III) trigonal-bipyramidal complex. A quantum dynamical investigation of the photo-deactivation mechanism in the Fe(III) system is presented using the multi-configurational time-dependent Hartree approach based on the vibronic Hamiltonian whose coupling terms are derived from the state-averaged complete active space self-consistent field/complete active space with second-order perturbation theory (CASPT2) calculations and spin–orbit coupling of the scalar-relativistic CASPT2 states. The results of this study show that the presence of a strong (non-relativistic) vibronic coupling between the optically bright intermediate-spin state and other low-lying states of the same spin-multiplicity overpowers the spin–orbit coupling between the intermediate-spin and high-spin states, thereby lowering the chances of spin-crossover while exhibiting ultrafast relaxation among the intermediate-spin states. In a special case, where the population transfer pathway via the non-relativistic vibronic coupling is blocked, the probability of the spin-crossover is found to increase. This suggests that a careful modification of the complex by incorporation of heavier atoms with stronger relativistic effects can enhance the spin-crossover potential of Fe(III) intermediate-spin complexes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}We present a novel technique to obtain a higher or lower value of dielectric constant due to the variation of a functional group on the surface of multiwall carbon nanotube (MWCNTs) for a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) grafted MWCNT system. We have prepared PVA grafted pristine and different types of functionalized (-COOH, -OH, and -NH2) MWCNT nanocomposite films. The strong interfacial interaction between the host PVA matrix and nanofiller is characterized by different experimental techniques. The frequency variation of the electrical transport properties of the composite films is investigated in a wide temperature range (303 ≤ T ≤ 413 K) and frequency range (20 Hz ≤ f ≤ 1 MHz). The dielectric constant of the amine (-NH2) functionalized MWCNT incorporated PVA film is about 2 times higher than that of the pristine MWCNT embedded PVA film. The temperature variation of the dielectric constant shows an anomalous behaviour. The modified Cole-Cole equation simulated the experimentally observed dielectric spectroscopy at high temperature. The ac conductivity of the composite films obeys the correlated barrier hopping model. The imaginary part of the electric modulus study shows the ideal Debye-type behaviour at low frequency and deviation of that at high frequency. To illustrate the impedance spectroscopy of the nanocomposite films, we have proposed an impedance based battery equivalent circuit model. The current-voltage characteristic shows hysteresis behaviour of the nanocomposite films. The trap state height for all composite films is evaluated by simulating the current density-electric field data with the Poole-Frenkel emission model. This investigation opens a new avenue for designing electronic devices with a suitable combination of cost effective soft materials.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The evolution of the magnetic properties of the CoPc/Ni system has been monitored by in situ magneto-optical spectroscopy, allowing us to follow not only the magnetic switching in real-time during deposition, but also the evolution of the optical properties of the CoPc as a function of coverage on the ferromagnetic Ni film.

The key to achieve this mix is to use a standard density functional theory (DFT) simulation as a preprocessor for the atomic and molecular information, obtaining a good quality electronic density. General, symmetry preserving, atom-centered electronic descriptors are then built from this density to train a neural network to correct the baseline DFT energies and forces. These electronic descriptors encode much more information than local atomic environments, allowing a simple neural network to reach the accuracy required for the problem of study at a negligible additional cost. The balance between accuracy and efficiency is determined by the baseline simulation. This is shown in results where high level quantum chemical accuracy is obtained for simulations of liquid water at standard DFT cost or where high level DFT-accuracy is achieved in simulations with a low-level baseline DFT calculation at a significantly reduced cost.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Here, through a field- and temperature-dependent study of the magnetisation dynamics of [Dy( $^{\textrm{t}}$ BuO)Cl(THF) $_{\textrm{5}}$ ][BPh $_{\textrm{4}}$ ]·2THF, we elucidate the different relaxation processes: field-independent Orbach and Raman mechanisms dominate at high temperatures, a single-phonon direct process dominates at low temperatures and fields \&gt;1 kOe, and a field- and temperature-dependent QTM process operates near zero field. Accounting for the exponential temperature dependence of the phonon collision rate in the QTM process, we model the magnetisation dynamics over 11 orders of magnitude and find a QTM tunnelling gap on the order of 10 $^{\textrm{−4}}$ to 10 $^{\textrm{−5}}$  cm $^{\textrm{−1}}$ . We show that removal of Dy nuclear spins does not suppress QTM, and argue that while internal dipolar fields and hyperfine coupling support QTM, it is the dynamic crystal field that drives efficient QTM. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The relative stability of high‐spin and low‐spin states has been studied in a series of Fe(II) complexes with model ligands of different σ donation strength. The natural (delocalized) orbitals are transformed to atomic‐like orbitals to analyze the multiconfigurational wave function in a valence bond picture. This analysis reveals a direct relation between the stabilization of the low‐spin state and the importance of the ligand‐to‐metal charge transfer in the σ orbitals. The multiconfigurational second‐order perturbation theory (CASPT2) energy dependence of the low‐spin state as function of the Fe‐ligand distance deviates significantly from coupled cluster (CCSD(T)) calculations. This is ascribed to the intrinsic multiconfigurational character of the wave function of the low‐spin state, invalidating the use of the simple closed‐shell reference in the coupled cluster calculations. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Our (semi-)automatic procedure determines the optimal training set size and composition of each constituent machine learning model, simultaneously minimizing the computational effort necessary to achieve the required accuracy of the hML PES. Machine learning models are built using kernel ridge regression, and training points are selected with structure-based sampling. As an illustrative example, hML is applied to a high-level ab initio CH3Cl PES and is shown to significantly reduce the computational cost of generating the PES by a factor of 100 while retaining similar levels of accuracy (errors of ∼1 cm−1).{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Octahedral Fe2+ molecules are particularly interesting as they often exhibit a spin-crossover transition. In spite of the many efforts aimed at assessing the performances of density functional theory for such systems, an exchange-correlation functional able to account accurately for the energetic of the various possible spin-states has not been identified yet. Here, we critically discuss the issues related to the theoretical description of this class of molecules from first principles. In particular, we present a comparison between different density functionals for four ions, namely, [Fe(H2O)6]2+, [Fe(NH3)6]2+, [Fe(NCH)6]2+, and [Fe(CO)6]2+. These are characterized by different ligand-field splittings and ground state spin multiplicities. Since no experimental data are available for the gas phase, the density functional theory results are benchmarked against those obtained with diffusion Monte Carlo, one of the most accurate methods available to compute ground state total energies of quantum systems. On the one hand, we show that most of the functionals considered provide a good description of the geometry and of the shape of the potential energy surfaces. On the other hand, the same functionals fail badly in predicting the energy differences between the various spin states. In the case of [Fe(H2O)6]2+, [Fe(NH3)6]2+, [Fe(NCH)6]2+, this failure is related to the drastic underestimation of the exchange energy. Therefore, quite accurate results can be achieved with hybrid functionals including about 50\% of Hartree-Fock exchange. In contrast, in the case of [Fe(CO)6]2+, the failure is likely to be caused by the multiconfigurational character of the ground state wave-function and no suitable exchange and correlation functional has been identified.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The value of U used here is evaluated by using constrained DFT method and found to be 6.9 eV. It is found that DFT result has limitations with energy positions of PDOS peaks due to its inability of creating a hard gap although the DOS distribution appears to be fine with experimental attributes. The calculated value of U is not an appropriate value for carrying out DFT+U calculations as it has created an insulating gap of 1.8 eV with limitations in redistribution of DOS which is inconsistent with experimental spectral behavior for the occupied states mainly. However, this value of U is found to be an appropriate one for DFT+embedded DMFT method which creates a gap of 1.1 eV. The calculated PDOS of Co 3d, La 5d, La 4f and O 2p states are giving a remarkably good explanation for the occupied and unoccupied states of the experimental spectra in the energy range –9.0 eV to 12.0 eV.},

To this purpose, we construct the most simple meta-GGA by expressing the local exchange-correlation energy per particle as a function of a fictitious density, which is obtained by inverting the Thomas-Fermi kinetic-energy functional. This simple functional considerably improves the total energy of atoms as compared to the standard local density approximation. The corresponding exchange-correlation potentials are then determined exactly through a solution of the optimized effective potential equation. These potentials support an additional bound state and exhibit a derivative discontinuity at integer particle numbers. We further demonstrate that through the kinetic-energy density any meta-GGA incorporates a derivative discontinuity. However, we also find that for commonly used meta-GGAs the discontinuity is largely underestimated and in some cases even negative.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The optically driven spin state transition can be mediated by a rich interplay of complexities including intermediate states in the spin state transition process, as well as intermolecular interactions, temperature, and strain. We emphasize here that the size reduction down to the nanoscale is essential for designing SCO systems that switch quickly as well as possibly retaining the memory of the light-driven state.

Experiments show that the shape of the high-spin → low-spin relaxation curves is drastically changed when the particles are dispersed in glycerol. This effect was considered in the model by means of interactions between the microparticles and the matrix. A faster start of the relaxation for microparticles embedded in glycerol is due to an initial positive local pressure acting on the edge spin-crossover molecules from the matrix side. This local pressure diminishes and eventually becomes negative during relaxation, as an effect of the decrease of the volume of spin-crossover microparticles from high-spin to low-spin.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The interest is partially technological, driven by the fast miniaturization of integrated circuits that now have reached characteristic features at the nanometer scale. Equally important, a very strong incentive also exists to elucidate the fundamental aspects of structure-function relations for nanoscale devices, which utilize molecular building blocks as functional units. Thus motivated, a rich research field has established itself, broadly termed “Molecular Electronics,” that hosts a plethora of activities devoted to this goal in chemistry, physics, and electrical engineering.

The proposed simple model structure and reduced force field allows us to obtain good orders of magnitude of the sound velocity in both spin states and takes into account the contribution of free surfaces in the vibrational properties of very thin films (below a thickness of 12 nm). The slab method issue from the field of surface physico-chemistry has been employed to extract surface thermodynamic quantities. In combination with the related slab-adapted method, the slab approach provides a powerful numerical tool to separate surface contributions from finite-size effects. Due to the relatively low stiffness of SCO materials, the lattice dynamics seems to be governed by surface instead of confinement effects. The size evolution of thermodynamic quantities is successfully reproduced, especially the increase of the vibrational entropy with the size reduction, in good agreement with experimental observations.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

They give rise to virtually all material properties and determine the physics at play in objects ranging from semiconductor devices to the interior of giant gas planets. Modeling and simulation of such diverse applications rely primarily on density functional theory (DFT), which has become the principal method for predicting the electronic structure of matter. While DFT calculations have proven to be very useful, their computational scaling limits them to small systems. We have developed a machine learning framework for predicting the electronic structure on any length scale. It shows up to three orders of magnitude speedup on systems where DFT is tractable and, more importantly, enables predictions on scales where DFT calculations are infeasible. Our work demonstrates how machine learning circumvents a long-standing computational bottleneck and advances materials science to frontiers intractable with any current solutions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The first order fragment approach does not contain data or parameters that are fitted to the final outcome of the molecular orbital-free calculation and thus represents a parameter-free implementation of orbital-free density functional theory, although it requires the precalculation of atomic data. Consequently, the proposed method is not limited to a specific type of molecule or chemical bonding. The different approximation levels arise from including (first order) or neglecting (zeroth order) the dependency between the potential and the electron density, which in the bifunctional approach are formally treated as independent variables.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Here, we elucidate these aspects by focusing on the adsorption of ferrocene on Cu(111) and Cu(100). Combining low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate that the two-dimensional molecular arrangement consists of vertical- and horizontal-lying molecules. The noncovalent T-shaped interactions between Cp rings of vertical and horizontal molecules are essential for the stability of the physisorbed molecular layer. These results provide a fresh insight into ferrocene adsorption on surfaces and may serve as an archetypal reference for future work with this important variety of organometallic molecules.},

The simulation results show that water molecules form polygon clusters on the interface, and most of which are hexagonal. Structures of water clusters at the interface are seen in two forms of curved and flattened polygons, which result in the formation of hydrogen bonds between and in the adjacent layers, respectively. Most of the clusters have circular flattened structures. Calculations of the lifetime of hydrogen bonds of water molecules at the interface also show that hydrogen bonds between water molecules at the interface have a low stability. This leads to the permanent formation and breaking down of hydrogen bonds of water molecules which can cause movement of water molecules and, consequently, the displacement of the center of mass and droplet motion. Considering the changes in the center of mass of a water droplet at the MoS2 interface display, the water droplet has a significant spontaneous motion.},

This work is an extension of our previous study of the hexaquoferrous cation, [Fe(H2O)6]2+, [J. Chem. Phys. 120, 9473 (2004)] to include a second compound—namely, the hexaminoferrous cation, [Fe(NH3)6]2+—and several additional functionals. In particular, the present study includes the highly parametrized generalized gradient approximations (GGAs) known as HCTH and the meta-GGA VSXC [which together we refer to as highly parametrized density functionals (HPDFs)], now readily available in the GAUSSIAN03 program, as well as the hybrid functional PBE0. Since there are very few experimental results for these molecules with which to compare, comparison is made with best estimates obtained from second-order perturbation theory-corrected complete active space self-consistent field (CASPT2) calculations, with spectroscopy oriented configuration interaction (SORCI) calculations, and with ligand field theory (LFT) estimations. While CASPT2 and SORCI are among the most reliable ab initio methods available for this type of problem, LFT embodies many decades of empirical experience. These three methods are found to give coherent results and provide best estimates of the adiabatic low-spin–high-spin energy difference, ΔELHadia, of 12 000–13 000 cm−1 for [Fe(H2O)6]2+ and 9 000–11 000 cm−1 for [Fe(NH3)6]2+. All functionals beyond the purely local approximation produce reasonably good geometries, so long as adequate basis sets are used. In contrast, the energy splitting, ΔELHadia, is much more sensitive to the choice of functional. The local density approximation severely over stabilizes the low-spin state with respect to the high-spin state. This “density functional theory (DFT) spin pairing-energy problem” persists, but is reduced, for traditional GGAs. In contrast the hybrid functional B3LYP underestimates ΔELHadia by a few thousands of wave numbers. The RPBE GGA of Hammer, Hansen, and Nørskov gives good results for ΔELHadia as do the HPDFs, especially the VSXC functional. Surprisingly the HCTH functionals actually over correct the DFT spin pairing-energy problem, destabilizing the low-spin state relative to the high-spin state. Best agreement is found for the hybrid functional PBE0.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The general phenomena which are classified as involving radiationless transitions, e.g., intersystem crossing, internal conversion, are discussed in terms of a unified Green's function formalism for the cases of the large, intermediate, and small molecule limits for both isolated molecules and molecules with external perturbers. Because of the existence of a natural time limit on any experiment, e.g., an isolated molecule description is only valid for a limited time, irreversibility can “effectively” occur on these relevant time scales in molecules which only have discrete energy levels. The introduction of this natural time limit allows the derivation of completely general criteria for the occurrence of irreversible electronic relaxation in isolated and perturbed polyatomic molecules. The dependence of these criteria on the type of radiationless process is elucidated in a general manner. For completeness, the excitation process is treated as well as the decay. Because we wish to examine the general phenomena encompressed in “radiationless transitions,” only a simplified model for the excitation is used. However, this simple model is sufficient to examine those general aspects of “radiationless transitions” which are independent of the “fine details” of the exciting light.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The decay of a manifold of closely spaced coupled levels is handled by applying the Green's function formalism for the transition probability, where the matrix elements are displayed in an energy representation which involves either the Born–Oppenheimer or the molecular eigenstate basis set. General criteria are obtained for the occurrence of an irreversible intramolecular electronic relaxation process. The features of radiationless transitions in large, medium-sized, and small molecules are elucidated, deriving general expressions for the radiative decay times and for the fluorescence quantum yields. Some possibilities for studying radiative interference effects in intersystem crossing are explored. A general theoretical demonstration of the occurrence of long radiative lifetimes of small molecules is presented.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

They may have important technological applications in information storage and quantum computation. We review the physical properties of two prototypical molecular nanomagnets, Mn $_{\textrm{12}}$ -acetate and Fe $_{\textrm{8}}$ : Each behaves as a rigid, spin-10 object and exhibits tunneling between up and down directions. As temperature is lowered, the spin-reversal process evolves from thermal activation to pure quantum tunneling. At low temperatures, magnetic avalanches occur in which the magnetization of an entire sample rapidly reverses. We discuss the important role that symmetry-breaking fields play in driving tunneling and in producing Berry-phase interference. Recent experimental advances indicate that quantum coherence can be maintained on timescales sufficient to allow a meaningful number of quantum computing operations to be performed. Efforts are under way to create monolayers and to address and manipulate individual molecules. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The molecule is contacted with gold nano-electrodes formed with the mechanically controllable break junction technique. We record the IETS spectrum of the molecule from direct current measurements, both as a function of time and electrode separation. We find that for fixed electrode separation the molecule switches between various configurations, which are characterized by different IETS spectra. Similar variations in the IETS signal are observed during atomic rearrangements upon stretching of the molecular junction. Using quantum chemistry calculations, we identity some of the vibrational modes which constitute a chemical fingerprint of the molecule. In addition, changes can be attributed to rearrangements of the local molecular environment, in particular at the molecule–electrode interface. This study shows the importance of taking into account the interaction with the electrodes when describing inelastic contributions to transport through single-molecule junctions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We focus on 3 {\textless}italic{\textgreater}d{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} and 4 {\textless}italic{\textgreater}d{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} transition metal dimers that have magnetic ground states in most cases. Some of these magnetic dimers have a considerable barrier against re‐orientation of their magnetization, the so‐called magnetic anisotropy energy, MAE. The height of this barrier is important for technological applications, as it determines, e.g., the stability of information stored in magnetic memory devices. It can be estimated by means of relativistic density functional calculations. Our approach is based on a full‐potential local‐orbital method (FPLO) in a four‐component Dirac‐Kohn‐Sham implementation. Orbital polarization corrections to the local density approximation are employed. They are discussed in the broader context of orbital dependent density functionals. Ground state properties (spin multiplicity, bond length, harmonic vibrational frequency, spin‐ and orbital magnetic moment, and MAE) of the 3 {\textless}italic{\textgreater}d{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} and 4 {\textless}italic{\textgreater}d{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} transition metal dimers are evaluated and compared with available experimental and theoretical data.

On the other hand, partial ELO techniques, whereby only a portion of the thin-film is detached from the substrate, can be employed to realize unconventional device structures or geometries, such as apertured, pivoted, and flexible devices, which may be exploited for various photonic structures or optical cavities.

Using density functional theory, we have studied the bulk and surface properties of metallic lithium at an atomistic level. In this process, bcc Li(100) proved to be the most stable metallic lithium surface. Subsequently, possible self-diffusion mechanisms on perfect and imperfect Li(100) surfaces were examined. For this purpose, nudged elastic band calculations were performed to characterize the respective diffusion processes and to determine the relevant pre-exponential factors and activation barriers. On the basis of the acquired data, it became possible to derive activation temperatures and reaction rates for the respective processes, which are useful for experimental verification as well as for the implementation in long-scale kinetic Monte Carlo simulations.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The isotropic magnetic moment of a free atom is shown to develop giant magnetic anisotropy energy due to symmetry reduction at an atomically ordered surface. Single cobalt atoms deposited onto platinum (111) are found to have a magnetic anisotropy energy of 9 millielectron volts per atom arising from the combination of unquenched orbital moments (1.1 Bohr magnetons) and strong spin-orbit coupling induced by the platinum substrate. By assembling cobalt nanoparticles containing up to 40 atoms, the magnetic anisotropy energy is further shown to be dependent on single-atom coordination changes. These results confirm theoretical predictions and are of fundamental value to understanding how magnetic anisotropy develops in finite-sized magnetic particles.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We note delocalization of the spin density onto acetate ligands due to π-back bonding, inverting spin polarization of the acetate oxygen atoms relative to that predicted from superexchange mechanism. This inversion may affect the performance of the models that assume strict localization of the spins on magnetic centers for the complexes with bridging acetate ligands. Next, we apply DFT+U methodology to Mn12 molecular wheel and find antiparallel spin alignment for the weakly interacting fragments Mn6, in agreement with experimental observations. Using the optimized geometry of the ground spin state instead of less accurate experimental geometry was found to be crucial for this good agreement.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}An elaborate approach for the prediction of magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectra in the framework of highly correlated multiconfigurational ab initio methods is presented. The MCD transitions are computed by the explicit treatment of spin-orbit coupled (SOC) and spin-spin coupled (SSC) N-electron states. These states are obtained from the diagonalization of the SOC and SSC operators along with the spin and orbital Zeeman operators in the basis of a preselected number of roots of the spin-free Hamiltonian. Therefore, zero-field splittings due to the SOC and SSC interactions along with the magnetic field splittings are explicitly accounted for in the ground as well as the excited states. This makes it possible to calculate simultaneously all MCD A, B, and C terms even beyond the linear response limit. The SOC is computed using a multicenter mean-field approximation to the Breit–Pauli Hamiltonian. Two-electron SSC terms are included in the treatment without further approximations. The MCD transition intensities are subjected to numerical orientational averaging in order to treat the most commonly encountered case of randomly oriented molecules. The simulated MCD spectra for the OH, NH, and CH radicals as well as for [Fe(CN)6]3− are in good agreement with the experimental spectra. In the former case, the significant effects of the inert gas matrices in which the experimental spectra were obtained were modeled in a phenomenological way.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}In this work, an implementation of an approach to calculate the zero-field splitting (ZFS) constants in the framework of ab initio methods such as complete active space self-consistent field, multireference configuration interaction, or spectroscopy oriented configuration interaction is reported. The spin-orbit coupling (SOC) contribution to ZFSs is computed using an accurate multicenter mean-field approximation for the Breit-Pauli Hamiltonian. The SOC parts of ZFS constants are obtained directly after diagonalization of the SOC operator in the basis of a preselected number of roots of the spin-free Hamiltonian. This corresponds to an infinite order treatment of the SOC in terms of perturbation theory. The spin-spin (SS) part is presently estimated in a mean-field fashion and appears to yield results close to the more complete treatments available in the literature. Test calculations for the first- and second-row atoms as well as first-row transition metal atoms and a set of diatomic molecules show accurate results for the SOC part of ZFSs. SS contributions have been found to be relatively small but not negligible (exceeding 1cm−1 for oxygen molecule). At least for the systems studied in this work, it is demonstrated that the presented method provides much more accurate estimations for the SOC part of ZFS constants than the emerging density functional theory approaches.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} Direct electrical probing of molecular materials is often impaired by their insulating nature. Here, graphene is interfaced with single crystals of a molecular spin crossover complex, [Fe(bapbpy)(NCS) $_{\textrm{2}}$ ], to electrically detect phase transitions in the molecular crystal through the variation of graphene resistance. Contactless sensing is achieved by separating the crystal from graphene with an insulating polymer spacer. Next to mechanical effects, which influence the conductivity of the graphene sheet but can be minimized by using a thicker spacer, a Dirac point shift in graphene is observed experimentally upon spin crossover. As confirmed by computational modeling, this Dirac point shift is due to the phase‐dependent electrostatic potential generated by the crystal inside the graphene sheet. This effect, named as chemo‐electric gating, suggests that molecular materials may serve as substrates for designing graphene‐based electronic devices. Chemo‐electric gating, thus, opens up new possibilities to electrically probe chemical and physical processes in molecular materials in a contactless fashion, from a large distance, which can enhance their use in technological applications, for example, as sensors. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The changes in the electronic and magnetic properties of a thin Co film upon adsorption of a layer of either the molecular organic electron donor tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) or the acceptor tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) have been investigated by X-ray absorption spectroscopy and X-ray magnetic circular dichroism using synchrotron radiation. Clear differences between the spectra of the adsorbed molecules and the neutral molecules show the hybridization of the molecular orbitals with the Co interface. Deposition of both organic materials leads to a small increase of the ratio of the orbital magnetic moment to the spin magnetic moment of the Co atoms at the interface. The main effect of overlayer deposition is a modification of the magnetic hysteresis of the Co film: The TCNQ slightly reduces the coercivity of the Co, while the TTF increases the coercivity by a factor of ∼1.5. These complementary effects of either a molecular organic electron donor or acceptor on the interfacial properties of a metal ferromagnetic thin film are a promising result for the controlled modification of the magnetic structure of hybrid interfaces.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Magnetoelectric coupling offers the possibility to change the magnetic state of a material by an applied electric field. Over the last few years, metallic systems have come up as simple prototypes for this interaction. While the previous studies focused on Fe and Co thin films or their alloys, here we demonstrate magnetoelectric coupling in a Ni thin film which is close to a spin-reorientation transition. Our magneto-optic Kerr effect measurements on 10 ML of Ni/Cu(100) show a considerable influence of the applied electric field on the magnetism. This rounds off the range of magnetic metals that exhibit magnetoelectric coupling, and it reveals the possibility of an electric field control of a spin-reorientation transition.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Using ab-initio numerical methods, we explore the spin-dependent transport and thermoelectric properties of a spin-crossover molecule (i.e., iron complex of 2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-6-(1H-tetrazole-5-yl)pyridine) based nano-junction. We demonstrate a large magnetoresistance, efficient conductance-switching, and spin-filter activity in this molecule-based two-terminal device. The spin-crossover process also modulates the thermoelectric entities. It can efficiently switch the magnitude as well as spin-polarization of the thermocurrent. We find that thermocurrent is changed by ∼4 orders of magnitude upon spin-crossover. Moreover, it also substantially affects the thermopower and consequently, the device shows extremely efficient spin-crossover magnetothermopower generation. Furthermore, by tuning the chemical potential of electrodes into a certain range, a pure spin-thermopower can be achieved for the high-spin state. Finally, the reasonably large values of figure-of-merit in the presence and absence of phonon demonstrate a large heat-to-voltage conversion efficiency of the device. We believe that our study will pave an alternative way of tuning the transport and thermoelectric properties through the spin-crossover process and can have potential applications in generation of spin-dependent current, information storage, and processing.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The ASR leverages the functionality of the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) to interface with external simulation codes and attain a high abstraction level. We provide a library of Recipes for common simulation tasks employing density functional theory and many-body perturbation schemes. These Recipes utilize the GPAW electronic structure code, but may be adapted to other simulation codes with an ASE interface. Being independent objects with automatic data provenance control, Recipes can be freely combined through Python scripting giving maximal freedom for users to build advanced workflows. ASR also implements a command line interface that can be used to run Recipes and inspect results. The ASR Migration module helps users maintain their data while the Database and App modules makes it possible to create local databases and present them as customized web pages.},

We represent the radial Green function as a combination of two fundamental solutions of the Dirac equation. The approach proposed includes a procedure of generating the relativistic electron functions Ψ with performance of the gauge invariance principle. To reach the gauge invariance principle performance, we use earlier developed QED perturbation theory approach. In the fourth order of the QED perturbation theory (PT) there are diagrams, whose contribution into imaginary part of radiation width {\textless}italic{\textgreater}ImdE{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} for the multielectron system accounts for many‐body correlation effects. A minimization of the functional {\textless}italic{\textgreater}ImdE{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} leads to integral‐differential Kohn‐Sham‐like density functional equations. Further check for the gauge principle performance is realized by means of the Ward identities. In the numerical procedure we use the effective algorithm, within which a definition of the Dirac equation fundamental solutions is reduced to solving the single system of the differential equations. This system includes also the differential equations for the Fermi‐model nuclear potential and equations for calculating the integrals of the ∫ ∫ {\textless}italic{\textgreater}dr{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} $_{\textrm{1}}$ {\textless}italic{\textgreater}dr{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} $_{\textrm{2}}$ type in the Mohr formula for definition of the self‐energy shift to atomic levels energies.

The optimized forms of the effective atomic potentials are used to calculate the band structures of the binary compounds, GaN, InN, and AlN. The calculated band structures are in excellent overall agreement with the experimental/ab initio values, i.e., the energy gaps at high-symmetry points, valence-band ordering, and effective masses for electrons match to within 3\%, with a few values within 5\%.

Herein, the temperature dependence of the energy barrier and carrier density at the MoS2/Si heterojunction has been extensively investigated. Furthermore, to study band alignment at the MoS2/Si interface, we have calculated a valence band offset of 0.66 ± 0.17 eV and a conduction band offset of 0.42 ± 0.17 eV using X-ray and Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy.

The abinit- 7.10.5 version contains new physical and technical features that allow electronic structure calculations impossible to carry out in the previous versions. Summary of revisions:•new physical features: quantum effects for the nuclei treated by the Path-integral Molecular Dynamics; finding transition states using image dynamics (NEB or string methods); two component DFT for electron-positron annihilation; linear response in a Projector Augmented-Wave approach -PAW-, electron-phonon interactions and temperature dependence of the gap; Bethe Salpeter Equation -BSE-; Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT).•new technical features: development of a PAW approach for a wavelet basis; parallelisation of the code on more than 10,000 processors; new build system.•new features in the ABINIT package: tests; test farm; new tutorials; new pseudopotentials and PAW atomic data tables; GUI and postprocessing tools like the AbiPy and APPA libraries.Running time: It is difficult to answer to the question as the use of ABINIT is very large. On one hand, ABINIT can run on 10,000 processors for hours to perform quantum molecular dynamics on large systems. On the other hand, tutorials for students can be performed on a laptop within a few minutes.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}We carried out first-principles spin-polarized calculations in order to study the adsorption and diffusion of 3d transition metal (TM = Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) atoms on a GaN(0001)- 2×2 surface using density functional theory within a plane-wave ultrasoft pseudopotential scheme. The results show that, for Ti, V, Cr, and Mn atoms, the most stable adsorption sites are all at the T4 site (the top site of the N-surface atom), whereas Fe, Co, and Ni slightly prefer the H3 hollow site. The adsorption energies can vary significantly with different TM atoms. A comparative study suggests that the TM–N bond formation is energetically more favorable for Ti, V, and Cr atoms, while the formation of a TM–Ga surface alloy is more favorable for elements such as Fe, Co, and Ni, as experimental results have shown. We found that the 3d TM adatom diffusion energy barrier between the H3 and T4 sites is around 0.40 eV, which is an indication of a significant TM adatom diffusion on the GaN(0001) surface. Furthermore, the total magnetic moment increases for Ti, V, Cr, and Mn adsorbates successively and then decreases for Fe, Co, and Ni adsorbates. The density of states indicates that the adsorption of Ti, V, and Cr atoms results in semiconductor behavior, while the adsorption of Mn, Fe, and Co atoms presents a half-metallic character. These properties make the TM/GaN systems promising for yielding high-efficiency metal-semiconductor spin injection devices.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Hexagonally stacked, single crystalline GaN nanocolumnar structure (nanotowers) grown on AlN buffer layer exhibits higher photocurrent generation due to high quality nanotowers morphology and increased surface/volume ratio which significantly enhances its responsivity upon ultraviolet exposure leading to outstanding performance from the developed detection device. The fabricated detector display low dark current ({\textasciitilde} 12 nA), high I $_{\textrm{Light}}$ /I $_{\textrm{Dark}}$ ratio (\&gt; 10 $^{\textrm{4}}$ ), fast time-correlated transient response ({\textasciitilde} 433 µs) upon ultraviolet (325 nm) illumination. A high photoresponsivity of 2.47 A/W is achieved in self-powered mode of operation. The reason behind such high performance could be attributed to built-in electric field developed from a difference in Schottky barrier heights will be discussed in detail. While in photoconductive mode, the responsivity is observed to be 35.4 A/W @ − 3 V along with very high external quantum efficiency ({\textasciitilde} 10 $^{\textrm{4}}$ \%), lower noise equivalent power ({\textasciitilde} 10 $^{\textrm{–13}}$ WHz $^{\textrm{−1/2}}$ ) and excellent UV–Vis selectivity. Nanotower structure with lower strain and dislocations as well as reduced trap states cumulatively contributed to augmented performance from the device. The utilization of these GaN-Nanotower structures can potentially be useful towards the fabrication of energy-efficient ultraviolet photodetectors. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The explicitly correlated approach is one of the most important breakthroughs in ab initio electronic structure theory, providing arguably the most compact, accurate, and efficient ansatz for describing the correlated motion of electrons. Since Hylleraas first used an explicitly correlated wave function for the He atom in 1929, numerous attempts have been made to tackle the significant challenges involved in constructing practical explicitly correlated methods that are applicable to larger systems. These include identifying suitable mathematical forms of a correlated wave function and an efficient evaluation of many-electron integrals. R12 theory, which employs the resolution of the identity approximation, emerged in 1985, followed by the introduction of novel correlation factors and wave function ansätze, leading to the establishment of F12 theory in the 2000s. Rapid progress in recent years has significantly extended the application range of explicitly correlated theory, offering the potential of an accurate wave-function treatment of complex systems such as photosystems and semiconductors. This perspective surveys explicitly correlated electronic structure theory, with an emphasis on recent stochastic and deterministic approaches that hold significant promise for applications to large and complex systems including solids.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The method of dispersion correction as an add-on to standard Kohn–Sham density functional theory (DFT-D) has been refined regarding higher accuracy, broader range of applicability, and less empiricism. The main new ingredients are atom-pairwise specific dispersion coefficients and cutoff radii that are both computed from first principles. The coefficients for new eighth-order dispersion terms are computed using established recursion relations. System (geometry) dependent information is used for the first time in a DFT-D type approach by employing the new concept of fractional coordination numbers (CN). They are used to interpolate between dispersion coefficients of atoms in different chemical environments. The method only requires adjustment of two global parameters for each density functional, is asymptotically exact for a gas of weakly interacting neutral atoms, and easily allows the computation of atomic forces. Three-body nonadditivity terms are considered. The method has been assessed on standard benchmark sets for inter- and intramolecular noncovalent interactions with a particular emphasis on a consistent description of light and heavy element systems. The mean absolute deviations for the S22 benchmark set of noncovalent interactions for 11 standard density functionals decrease by 15\%–40\% compared to the previous (already accurate) DFT-D version. Spectacular improvements are found for a tripeptide-folding model and all tested metallic systems. The rectification of the long-range behavior and the use of more accurate C6 coefficients also lead to a much better description of large (infinite) systems as shown for graphene sheets and the adsorption of benzene on an Ag(111) surface. For graphene it is found that the inclusion of three-body terms substantially (by about 10\%) weakens the interlayer binding. We propose the revised DFT-D method as a general tool for the computation of the dispersion energy in molecules and solids of any kind with DFT and related (low-cost) electronic structure methods for large systems.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Thin films of several elements—manganese, nickel, palladium, arsenic, and antimony—were formed by the physical vapor deposition method. The results of the bare surfaces, as well as the thin film/GaN(0001) phase boundaries presented, were characterized by X-ray and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopies (XPS, UPS). Basic information on the electronic properties of GaN(0001) surfaces are shown. Different behaviors of the thin films, after postdeposition annealing in ultrahigh vacuum conditions such as surface alloying and subsurface dissolving and desorbing, were found. The metal films formed surface alloys with gallium (MnGa, NiGa, PdGa), while the semimetal (As, Sb) layers easily evaporate from the GaN(0001) surface. However, the layer in direct contact with the substrate could react with it, modifying the surface properties of GaN(0001).{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The transfer of the inherent bistability of spin crossover compounds to surfaces has attracted considerable interest in recent years. The deposition of the complexes on surfaces allows investigating them individually and to further understand the microscopic mechanisms at play. Moreover, it offers the prospect of engineering switchable functional surfaces. We review recent progress in the field with a particular focus on the challenges and limits associated with the dominant experimental techniques used, namely near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). One of the main difficulties in NEXAFS-based experiments is to ascertain that the complexes are in direct contact with the surfaces. We show that molecular coverage determination based on the amplitude of the edge-jump of interest is challenging because the latter quantity depends on the substrate. Furthermore, NEXAFS averages the signals of a large number of molecules, which may be in different states. In particular, we highlight that the signal of fragmented molecules is difficult to distinguish from that of intact and functional ones. In contrast, STM allows investigating individual complexes, but the identification of the spin states is at best done indirectly. As quite some of the limits of the techniques are becoming apparent as the field is gaining maturity, their detailed descriptions will be useful for future investigations and for taking a fresh look at earlier reports.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The high computational speed on the one hand and the accuracy comparable to that of density functional theory on another hand make machine learning algorithms efficient for high-throughput screening through chemical and configurational space. However, the machine learning algorithms available in the literature require large training datasets to reach the chemical accuracy and also show large errors for the so-called outliers—the out-of-sample molecules, not well-represented in the training set. In the present paper, we propose a new machine learning algorithm for predicting molecular properties that addresses these two issues: it is based on a local model of interatomic interactions providing high accuracy when trained on relatively small training sets and an active learning algorithm of optimally choosing the training set that significantly reduces the errors for the outliers. We compare our model to the other state-of-the-art algorithms from the literature on the widely used benchmark tests.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

These considerations led to examination of the relation between the order parameters during temperature changes. Starting from the phenomenological Hamiltonian, entropy has been derived using the mean field approach. Finally, the phase diagram, which characterizes the system, is numerically analyzed.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We report surprisingly large and bias-induced (differential) spin-injection (detection) polarizations up to 50\% (135\%) at a positive voltage bias of + 0.6 V, as well as sign inverted polarizations up to −70\% (−60\%) at a reverse bias of −0.4 V. This demonstrates the potential of bilayer-hBN tunnel barriers for practical graphene spintronics applications. With such enhanced spin-injection and detection polarizations, we report a record two-terminal (inverted) spin-valve signals up to 800 Ω with a magnetoresistance ratio of 2.7\%, and achieve spin accumulations up to 4.1 meV.

This vertical setup has recently gained significant interest in experiment for the design of particularly stable and reproducible devices. We observe that the signals from the molecule in the electronic transmission are overlayed by the signatures of the graphene sheet, thus raising the need for a reinterpretation of the transmission. On the other hand, we see that our results are stable with respect to various defects in the graphene. For weakly physiosorbed molecules, no signs of interaction with the graphene are evident, so the transport properties are determined by offresonant tunnelling between the gold leads across an extended structure that includes the molecule itself and the additional graphene layer. Compared with pure gold electrodes, calculated conductances are about one order of magnitude lower due to the increased tunnelling distance. Relative differences upon changing the end group and the length of the molecule on the other hand, are similar.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The interactions between atoms and electrons are governed by the laws of quantum mechanics; hence, accurate and efficient techniques for solving the basic quantum-mechanical equations for complex many-atom, many-electron systems must be developed. Density functional theory (DFT) marks a decisive breakthrough in these efforts, and in the past decade DFT has had a rapidly growing impact not only on fundamental but also industrial research. This article discusses the fundamental principles of DFT and the highly efficient computational tools that have been developed for its application to complex problems in materials science.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Unrestricted density functional theory (DFT) methods are typically expected to describe the homolytic dissociation of nonpolar single bonds in neutral species with qualitative accuracy, due to the lack of significant delocalization error. We however find that many widely used density functional approximations fail to describe features along the dissociation curve of the simple H2 molecule. This is not a universal failure of DFT in the sense that many classic functionals like PBE and B3LYP give very reasonable results, as do some more modern methods like MS2. However, some other widely used functionals like B97-D (empirically fitted) and TPSS (non-empirically constrained) predict qualitatively wrong static polarizabilities, force constants, and some even introduce an artificial barrier against association of independent H atoms to form H2. The polarizability and force constant prediction failures appear to stem from incomplete spin localization into individual H atoms beyond the Coulson-Fischer point, resulting in “fractionally bonded” species where the ionic contributions to the Slater determinant are not completely eliminated, unlike the case of unrestricted Hartree-Fock. These errors therefore appear to be a consequence of poor self-consistent density prediction by the problematic functional. The same reasons could potentially lead to spurious barriers toward H atom association, indirectly also leading to incorrect forces. These unphysicalities suggest that the use of problematic functionals is probably unwise in ab initio dynamics calculations, especially if strong electrostatic interactions are possible.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Recent experiments reported that spin state transitions were realized by applying bias voltages. However, these bias-induced transitions are not fully understood, especially the mechanism. It is well established in experiments that the metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) excitation activated by light radiation can lead to the transition from low spin (LS) to high spin (HS), and the transition from HS to LS can be achieved by light due to the metal-centered (MC) excitation. Moreover, electronic excitations are accessible by inelastic cotunneling in molecular junctions under bias voltages. Based on these two facts, we propose that the MLCT excitation is responsible for the bias-induced transition from LS to HS, and the bias-induced transition from HS to LS is attributed to the MC excitation. The rationality of our proposed mechanism is demonstrated by comparing first-principles results and experimental observations. Threshold voltages of MLCT and MC excitations predicted in theory are consistent with bias voltages used to reach the transition from LS to HS and that from HS to LS in the experiment [Miyamachi et al., Nat. Commun. 3, 938 (2012)]. Activation of MLCT or MC excitation depends on the bias polarity, which can explain the bias-polarity dependence of the transition in the experiment. Our study is important for further design of molecular spintronic devices working on the bias-controlled transition.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}We propose a physically motivated decomposition of density functional theory (DFT) 3-body nonadditive interaction energies into the exchange and density-deformation (polarization) components. The exchange component represents the effect of the Pauli exclusion in the wave function of the trimer and is found to be challenging for density functional approximations (DFAs). The remaining density-deformation nonadditivity is less dependent upon the DFAs. Numerical demonstration is carried out for rare gas atom trimers, Ar2–HX (X = F, Cl) complexes, and small hydrogen-bonded and van der Waals molecular systems. None of the tested semilocal, hybrid, and range-separated DFAs properly accounts for the nonadditive exchange in dispersion-bonded trimers. By contrast, for hydrogen-bonded systems, range-separated DFAs achieve a qualitative agreement to within 20\% of the reference exchange energy. A reliable performance for all systems is obtained only when the monomers interact through the Hartree-Fock potential in the dispersion-free Pauli blockade scheme. Additionally, we identify the nonadditive second-order exchange-dispersion energy as an important but overlooked contribution in force-field-like dispersion corrections. Our results suggest that range-separated functionals do not include this component, although semilocal and global hybrid DFAs appear to imitate it in the short range.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

However, difficulties in achieving reasonable efficiencies, and thus cost-effectiveness, have hampered significant research progress. Here we propose the use of semiconductor nanostructures to create a type-II heterojunction at the semiconductor–water interface in a photoelectrochemical cell (PEC) and theoretically investigate it as a method of increasing the maximum photovoltage such a cell can generate under illumination, with the aim of increasing the overall cell efficiency.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}A central object in the computational studies of rare events is the committor function. Though costly to compute, the committor function encodes complete mechanistic information of the processes involving rare events, including reaction rates and transition-state ensembles. Under the framework of transition path theory, Rotskoff et al. [Proceedings of the 2nd Mathematical and Scientific Machine Learning Conference, Proceedings of Machine Learning Research (PLMR, 2022), Vol. 145, pp. 757–780] proposes an algorithm where a feedback loop couples a neural network that models the committor function with importance sampling, mainly umbrella sampling, which collects data needed for adaptive training. In this work, we show additional modifications are needed to improve the accuracy of the algorithm. The first modification adds elements of supervised learning, which allows the neural network to improve its prediction by fitting to sample-mean estimates of committor values obtained from short molecular dynamics trajectories. The second modification replaces the committor-based umbrella sampling with the finite-temperature string (FTS) method, which enables homogeneous sampling in regions where transition pathways are located. We test our modifications on low-dimensional systems with non-convex potential energy where reference solutions can be found via analytical or finite element methods, and show how combining supervised learning and the FTS method yields accurate computation of committor functions and reaction rates. We also provide an error analysis for algorithms that use the FTS method, using which reaction rates can be accurately estimated during training with a small number of samples. The methods are then applied to a molecular system in which no reference solution is known, where accurate computations of committor functions and reaction rates can still be obtained.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} Conventional band structure calculations in the local density approximation (LDA) [1–3] are highly successful for many materials, but miss important aspects of the physics and energetics of strongly correlated electron systems, such as transition metal oxides and f‐electron systems displaying, e.g., Mott insulating and heavy quasiparticle behavior. In this respect, the LDA + DMFT approach which merges LDA with a modern many‐body approach, the dynamical mean‐field theory (DMFT), has proved to be a breakthrough for the realistic modeling of correlated materials. Depending on the strength of the electronic correlation, a LDA + DMFT calculation yields the weakly correlated LDA results, a strongly correlated metal, or a Mott insulator. In this paper, the basic ideas and the set‐up of the LDA + DMFT(X) approach, where X is the method used to solve the DMFT equations, are discussed. Results obtained with X = QMC (quantum Monte Carlo) and X = NCA (non‐crossing approximation) are presented and compared, showing that the method X matters quantitatively. We also discuss LDA + DMFT results for two prime examples of correlated materials, i.e., V $_{\textrm{2}}$ O $_{\textrm{3}}$ and Ce which undergo a Mott–Hubbard metal–insulator and volume collapse transition, respectively.

The phenomenon is demonstrated for two different compounds diluted in a commercial polymer. The photo-induced transition is due to laser-induced heating of the host-matrix, which results in a localized modification of the properties of the sample. This phenomenon is reversible, and its kinetics are well accounted for by a simple model. This process makes it possible to write optical information at a high speed and to erase it in such materials.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In particular, we introduce time-independent Green's functions and the Dyson equation to solve problems with an external potential.

In the present work, we develop a new hybrid density functional based on a screened Coulomb potential for the exchange interaction which circumvents this bottleneck. The results obtained for structural and thermodynamic properties of molecules are comparable in quality to the most widely used hybrid functionals. In addition, we present results of periodic boundary condition calculations for both semiconducting and metallic single wall carbon nanotubes. Using a screened Coulomb potential for Hartree–Fock exchange enables fast and accurate hybrid calculations, even of usually difficult metallic systems. The high accuracy of the new screened Coulomb potential hybrid, combined with its computational advantages, makes it widely applicable to large molecules and periodic systems.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Our calculations show that the interaction between graphene and MoS2 monolayer is a weak van der Waals interaction in all four stacking configurations with the binding energy per carbon atom of −30 meV. In the presence of MoS2 monolayer, the linear bands on the Dirac cone of graphene at the interfaces are slightly split. A band gap about 3 meV opens in G/MoS2 interfaces due to the breaking of sublattice symmetry by the intrinsic interface dipole, and it could be effectively modulated by the stacking configurations. Furthermore, we found that an n-type Schottky contact is formed at the G/MoS2 interface in all four stacking configurations with a small Schottky barrier about 0.49 eV. The appearance of the non-zero band gap in graphene has opened up new possibilities for its application in electronic devices such as graphene field-effect transistors.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This dataset is used to train the boosted regression tree algorithm, which allows a computationally efficient and accurate prediction of molecular ground state energies. Predictions from boosted regression trees are compared with neural network regression, a widely used method in the literature, and shown to be more accurate with significantly reduced computational cost. The performance of the regression model trained using the CHNOPS set is also tested on a set of distinct molecules that contain additional Cl and Si atoms.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Restricted Hartree–Fock (RHF) and UHF wavefunctions for beryllium-like ions with nuclear charge 3 ⩽ Z ⩽ 5 are found using a near-complete Slater basis set. The triplet (RHF → UHF) instability and correlation energy are investigated as a function of Z and we find that the instability vanishes for Z \&amp;gt; 4.5. We reproduce this surprising behavior using a minimal-basis model and, by comparing with the stretched H2 molecule, conclude that “static” (also known as nondynamical, near-degeneracy, first-order, or strong) correlation comes in two flavors: one that can be captured by UHF and another that cannot. In the former (Type A), there is an “absolute near-degeneracy”; in the latter (Type B), there is a “relative near-degeneracy.” This dichotomy clarifies discussions of static correlation effects.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}We present a machine learning approach for accurately predicting formation energies of binary compounds in the context of crystal structure predictions. The success of any machine learning model depends significantly on the choice of representation used to encode the relevant physical information into machine-learnable data. We test different representation schemes based on partial radial and angular distribution functions (RDF+ADF) on Al–Ni and Cd–Te structures generated using our genetic algorithm for structure prediction. We observe a remarkable improvement in predictive accuracy upon transitioning from global to atom-centered representations, resulting in a threefold decrease in prediction errors. We show that a support vector regression model using a combination of atomic radial and angular distribution functions performs best at the formation energy prediction task, providing small root mean squared errors of 3.9 meV/atom and 10.9 meV/atom for Al–Ni and Cd–Te, respectively. We test the performance of our models against common traditional descriptors and find that RDF- and ADF-based representations significantly outperform many of those in the prediction of formation energies. The high accuracy of predictions makes our machine learning models great candidates for the exploration of energy landscapes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The results of applying the Hartree-Fock approximation to this model are examined. Using a Green function technique an approximate solution of the correlation problem for this model is obtained. This solution has the property of reducing to the exact atomic solution in the appropriate limit and to the ordinary uncorrelated band picture in the opposite limit. The condition for ferromagnetism of this solution is discussed. To clarify the physical meaning of the solution a two-electron example is examined. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Phys. 131, 054106 (2009)] to compute the ground state of correlated many-electron systems, an extension to the computation of excited states (exFCIQMC) is presented. The Hilbert space is divided into a large part consisting of pure Slater determinants and a much smaller orthogonal part (the size of which is controlled by a cut-off threshold), from which the lowest eigenstates can be removed efficiently. In this way, the quantum Monte Carlo algorithm is restricted to the orthogonal complement of the lower excited states and projects out the next highest excited state. Starting from the ground state, higher excited states can be found one after the other. The Schrödinger equation in imaginary time is solved by the same population dynamics as in the ground state algorithm with modified probabilities and matrix elements, for which working formulae are provided. As a proof of principle, the method is applied to lithium hydride in the 3-21G basis set and to the helium dimer in the aug-cc-pVDZ basis set. It is shown to give the correct electronic structure for all bond lengths. Much more testing will be required before the applicability of this method to electron correlation problems of interesting size can be assessed.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

However, this criterion is not satisfied for some SiX(111) interfaces. The aim of this work is to study the temperature-induced changes in the structure of the heterostructures under consideration and to clarify a possible origin of instability of the interfaces in them. It is shown that, at finite temperatures, the interfacial layer in the TiN(001)/SiC heterostructure transforms into the zinc blende-type (B3) SiC-like layer, whereas the interfaces in other (001) heterostructures transform into amorphous-like interfacial layers. The TiC(111)/SiC and TiN(111)/SiN heterostructures are stable up to 1400 K. The TiN(111)/B3-like SiC and TiC(111)/B3-like SiN systems form during static relaxation of the initial heterostructures. The phase transformations of the interfaces are explained in terms of dynamical and elastic stability criteria. In contrast to the (111) interfacial layers, all the B1-(001) interfaces are found to be dynamically unstable. The formation of the B3-(111) interfaces occurs due to the elastic instability of the corresponding B1-(111) interface.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Polymer solar cells admit numerous potential advantages including low energy payback time and scalable high-speed manufacturing, but the power conversion efficiency is currently lower than for their inorganic counterparts. In a Phenyl-C\_61-Butyric-Acid-Methyl-Ester (PCBM)-based blended polymer solar cell, the optical gap of the polymer and the energetic alignment of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the polymer and the PCBM are crucial for the device efficiency. Searching for new and better materials for polymer solar cells is a computationally costly affair using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. In this work, we propose a screening procedure using a simple string representation for a promising class of donor-acceptor polymers in conjunction with a grammar variational autoencoder. The model is trained on a dataset of 3989 monomers obtained from DFT calculations and is able to predict LUMO and the lowest optical transition energy for unseen molecules with mean absolute errors of 43 and 74 meV, respectively, without knowledge of the atomic positions. We demonstrate the merit of the model for generating new molecules with the desired LUMO and optical gap energies which increases the chance of finding suitable polymers by more than a factor of five in comparison to the randomised search used in gathering the training set.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

At the highest tested laser power of 0.1 mW, we find ten-fold enhancements to both the output current and carrier field-effect mobility at the illumination wavelength of 488 nm. We suggest that the improvement of electrical performance is due to the surface presence of MoOx resulting from the chemical conversion of MoS2 by the oxygen-containing plasma.

The devices were fabricated both on a rigid SiO2/Si substrate and on a flexible poly(ethylene terephthalate) substrate. Using these devices, we investigated the basic charge transport characteristics of benzenedithiolate molecular junctions in length- and temperature-dependent analyses. Additionally, the reliability of the electrical characteristics of the flexible benzenedithiolate molecular devices was investigated under various mechanical bending conditions, such as different bending radii, repeated bending cycles, and a retention test under bending. We also observed the inelastic electron tunneling spectra of our fabricated graphene–electrode molecular devices. Based on the results, we verified that benzenedithiolate molecules participate in charge transport, serving as an active tunneling barrier in solid-state graphene–electrode molecular junctions.},

As a bonus, linear-scaling algorithms are also presented for the second-order screened exchange extension of dRPA as well as for the second-order Møller–Plesset (MP2) method and its spin-scaled variants. Our approach is based on an incremental scheme which is an extension of our previous local correlation method [Rolik et al., J. Chem. Phys. 139, 094105 (2013)]. The approach extensively uses local natural orbitals to reduce the size of the molecular orbital basis of local correlation domains. In addition, we also demonstrate that using natural auxiliary functions [M. Kállay, J. Chem. Phys. 141, 244113 (2014)], the size of the auxiliary basis of the domains and thus that of the three-center Coulomb integral lists can be reduced by an order of magnitude, which results in significant savings in computation time. The new approach is validated by extensive test calculations for energies and energy differences. Our benchmark calculations also demonstrate that the new method enables dRPA calculations for molecules with more than 1000 atoms and 10 000 basis functions on a single processor.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} The quantum mechanical screening of a spin via conduction electrons depends sensitively on the environment seen by the magnetic impurity. A high degree of responsiveness can be obtained with metal complexes, as the embedding of a metal ion into an organic molecule prevents intercalation or alloying and allows for a good control by an appropriate choice of the ligands. There are therefore hopes to reach an “on demand” control of the spin state of single molecules adsorbed on substrates. Hitherto one route was to rely on “switchable” molecules with intrinsic bistabilities triggered by external stimuli, such as temperature or light, or on the controlled dosing of chemicals to form reversible bonds. However, these methods constrain the functionality to switchable molecules or depend on access to atoms or molecules. Here, we present a way to induce bistability also in a planar molecule by making use of the environment. We found that the particular “habitat” offered by an antiphase boundary of the Rashba system BiAg $_{\textrm{2}}$ stabilizes a second structure for manganese phthalocyanine molecules, in which the central Mn ion moves out of the molecular plane. This corresponds to the formation of a large magnetic moment and a concomitant change of the ground state with respect to the conventional adsorption site. The reversible spin switch found here shows how we can not only rearrange electronic levels or lift orbital degeneracies via the substrate, but even sway the effects of many-body interactions in single molecules by acting on their surrounding. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This transition is abrupt and occurs with a thermal hysteresis, which confers a memory effect on the system. The intersite interactions and thus the cooperativity are magnified in polymeric compounds such as [Fe(Rtrz) $_{\textrm{3}}$ ]A $_{\textrm{2}}$ ·nH $_{\textrm{2}}$ O in which the Fe $^{\textrm{2+}}$ ions are triply bridged by 4-R-substituted-1,2,4-triazole molecules. Moreover, in these compounds, the spin transition is accompanied by a well-pronounced change of color between violet in the LS state and white in the HS state. The transition temperatures of these materials can be fine tuned, using an approach based on the concept of a molecular alloy. In particular, it is possible to design a compound for which room temperature falls in the middle of the thermal hysteresis loop. These materials have many potential applications, for example, as temperature sensors, as active elements of various types of displays, and in information storage and retrieval. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Despite ML’s impressive performance in commercial applications, several unique challenges exist when applying ML in materials science applications. In such a context, the contributions of this work are twofold. First, we identify common pitfalls of existing ML techniques when learning from underrepresented/imbalanced material data. Specifically, we show that with imbalanced data, standard methods for assessing quality of ML models break down and lead to misleading conclusions. Furthermore, we find that the model’s own confidence score cannot be trusted and model introspection methods (using simpler models) do not help as they result in loss of predictive performance (reliability-explainability trade-off). Second, to overcome these challenges, we propose a general-purpose explainable and reliable machine-learning framework. Specifically, we propose a generic pipeline that employs an ensemble of simpler models to reliably predict material properties. We also propose a transfer learning technique and show that the performance loss due to models’ simplicity can be overcome by exploiting correlations among different material properties. A new evaluation metric and a trust score to better quantify the confidence in the predictions are also proposed. To improve the interpretability, we add a rationale generator component to our framework which provides both model-level and decision-level explanations. Finally, we demonstrate the versatility of our technique on two applications: (1) predicting properties of crystalline compounds and (2) identifying potentially stable solar cell materials. We also point to some outstanding issues yet to be resolved for a successful application of ML in material science.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Here, we demonstrate the spin filtering effect in cobalt{\textbar}few layer h-BN{\textbar}graphene junctions leading to a large negative spin polarization in graphene at room temperature.

Detailed bias and gate dependent measurements reinforce the robustness of the effect in our devices.

In this review, we summarize the recent advances of this field in terms of the external stimulus that induces the switching. A variety of external stimuli, such as light, electric field, magnetic field, mechanical force, and chemical stimulus, have been successfully employed to activate the reversible switching in single‐molecule junctions by manipulating molecular structures, conformations, electronic states, and spin states. As a burgeoning field, we finally put forward the challenges in molecular electronics and spintronics that need to be solved, which will initiate intense research.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Outside the core region the nodeless radial pseudo-valence wavefunction is taken to be identical to the real wavefunction and inside it is represented by a smooth analytical function. Both the first and the second derivatives of the radial pseudo-wavefunction are matched to the ab initio result at a core radius which depends on angular momentum. The resulting non-local self-consistent core pseudopotential is energy independent over a wide energy range. It is smooth and non-singular and is suitable for solid state bandstructure methods which make use of plane wave basis set expansions. This approach is so simple that it can be mostly carried out analytically, in contrast to a recently proposed method in which a pseudopotential is obtained by modifying the atomic potential instead of the wavefunction.},

Phys. 149, 044121 (2018)] is extended to the case of interacting electrons. We consider a general problem of quantum transport of interacting electrons through a central region with dynamically changing geometry. The approach is based on the separation of time scales in the non-equilibrium Green’s functions and the use of the Wigner transformation to solve the Kadanoff-Baym equations. The Green’s functions and correlation self-energy are non-adiabatically expanded up to the second order central time derivatives. We produce expressions for Green’s functions with non-adiabatic corrections and a modified formula for electric current; both depend not only on instantaneous molecular junction geometry but also on nuclear velocities and accelerations. The theory is illustrated by the study of electron transport through a model single-resonant level molecular junction with local electron-electron repulsion and a dynamically changing geometry.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Wafer-scale CVD MoS2 films with 2, 4, and 12 layers were fabricated on SiO2, and their properties were evaluated by using Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopies. In accordance with our X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results, our Kelvin probe force microscopy investigation found that the surface potential of the MoS2 films increases by ∼0.15 eV when the number of layers is increased from 2 to 12. Photoemission spectroscopy (PES) with in-situ annealing under ultra high vacuum conditions was used to directly demonstrate that this work function shift is associated with the screening effects of oxygen or water molecules adsorbed on the film surface. After annealing, it was found with PES that the surface potential decreases by ∼0.2 eV upon the removal of the adsorbed layers, which confirms that adsorbed species have a role in the variation in the work function.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

However, the x-rays itself can induce a spin transition and might have unwanted influence while investigating the effect of other stimuli such as temperature or light, or of the surface, on the spin switching behaviour. Herein, we present the spin switching of an Fe(II) complex adsorbed on a highly oriented pyrolytic graphite surface with particular emphasis on the x-ray-induced switching. For a submonolayer coverage, the complex undergoes a complete and reversible temperature- and light-induced spin transition. The spin states are switched both ways by x-rays at 5 K, i.e. from the high-spin state to the low-spin state or vice versa, depending on the relative amount of each species. Furthermore, we quantify the fraction of molecules undergoing soft x-ray-induced photochemistry, a process which results in an irreversible low-spin state component, for a particular exposure time. This can be greatly suppressed by reducing the beam intensity.},

Individual atomic spins have recently exhibited magnetic remanence, a requirement for magnetic memory. However, such memory has been only realized on thin insulating surfaces, removing potential tunability via electronic gating or exchange-driven magnetic coupling. Here, we show a previously unobserved mechanism for single-atom magnetic storage based on bistability in the orbital population, or so-called valency, of an individual Co atom on semiconducting black phosphorus (BP). Ab initio calculations reveal that distance-dependent screening from the BP surface stabilizes the two distinct valencies, each with a unique orbital population, total magnetic moment, and spatial charge density. Excellent correspondence between the measured and predicted charge densities reveal that such orbital configurations can be accessed and manipulated without a spin-sensitive readout mechanism. This orbital memory derives stability from the energetic barrier to atomic relaxation, demonstrating the potential for high-temperature single-atom information storage.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Substrate, environment, and lattice imperfections have a strong impact on the local electronic structure and the optical properties of atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides. We find by a comparative study of MoS2 on SiO2 and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) using scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) measurements that the apparent bandgap of MoS2 on SiO2 is significantly reduced compared to MoS2 on hBN. The bandgap energies as well as the exciton binding energies determined from all-optical measurements are very similar for MoS2 on SiO2 and hBN. This discrepancy is found to be caused by a substantial amount of band tail states near the conduction band edge of MoS2 supported by SiO2. The presence of those states impacts the local density of states in STS measurements and can be linked to a broad red-shifted photoluminescence peak and a higher charge carrier density that are all strongly diminished or even absent using high quality hBN substrates. By taking into account the substrate effects, we obtain a quasiparticle gap that is in excellent agreement with optical absorbance spectra and we deduce an exciton binding energy of about 0.53 eV on SiO2 and 0.44 eV on hBN.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Each unit is represented not only by its open-shell ground state wave function, but also by an admixture of singly excited configurations which account for the spin polarization effect and may lead to negative spin densities in some regions. The states of the two units are then coupled in a valence-bond-type fashion resulting in an exchange coupling constant J expressed in terms of orbitals localized on each unit. It consists of three parts: (a) interaction of the ground state terms; (b) interaction of the spin polarization term of unit A with the ground state term of B; and (c) vice versa. The latter two contributions can be considered as an exchange interaction involving negative spin densities as has been first suggested by McConnell for the intermolecular coupling between alternant hydrocarbons. It is shown that they follow the same simple spin algebra given by the general form of a Heisenberg Hamiltonian as contribution (a) and that they also have a similar structure. The relation between the coupling constant and the spin density is discussed.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The focus here is on interactions between the graphene surface and the adsorbed molecules, including small gas molecules (H2O, H2, O2, CO, NO2, NO, and NH3), aromatic, and non-aromatic molecules (F4-TCNQ, PTCDA, TPA, Na-NH2, An-CH3, An-Br, Poly (ethylene imine) (PEI), and diazonium salts), and various biomolecules such as peptides, DNA fragments, and other derivatives. This is followed by a discussion on graphene-based gas sensor concepts. InÃÂÃÂ reviewing the studies of the effects of molecular adsorption on graphene, it is evident that the strong manipulation of grapheneÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs electronic structure, including p- and n-doping, is not only possible with molecular adsorbates, but that this approach appears to be superior compared to these exploiting edge effects, local defects, or strain. However, graphene-based gas sensors, albeit feasible because huge adsorbate-induced variations in the relative conductivity are possible, generally suffer from the lack of chemical selectivity.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}With the increasing use of thin dielectric decoupling layers to study the electronic properties of organic molecules on metal surfaces, comparative studies are needed in order to generalize findings and formulate practical rules. In this paper we study the adsorption and electronic properties of pentacene deposited onto h-BN/Rh(111) and compare them with those of pentacene deposited onto KCl on various metal surfaces. When deposited onto KCl, the HOMO and LUMO energies of the pentacene molecules scale with the work functions of the combined KCl/metal surface. The magnitude of the variation between the respective KCl/metal systems indicates the degree of interaction of the frontier orbitals with the underlying metal. The results confirm that the so-called IDIS model developed by Willenbockel et al. applies not only to molecular layers on bare metal surfaces, but also to individual molecules on thin electronically decoupling layers. Depositing pentacene onto h-BN/Rh(111) results in significantly different adsorption characteristics, due to the topographic corrugation of the surface as well as the lateral electric fields it presents. These properties are reflected in the divergence from the aforementioned trend for the orbital energies of pentacene deposited onto h-BN/Rh(111), as well as in the different adsorption geometry. Thus, the highly desirable capacity of h-BN to trap molecules comes at the price of enhanced metal–molecule interaction, which decreases the HOMO–LUMO gap of the molecules. In spite of the enhanced interaction, the molecular orbitals are evident in scanning tunnelling spectroscopy (STS) and their shapes can be resolved by spectroscopic mapping.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In this paper of the series, the concepts needed to model infinite systems are introduced. These comprise the unit cell in real space, as well as its counterpart in reciprocal space, the Brillouin zone. Grids for sampling the Brillouin zone and finite k-point sets are discussed. For metallic systems, these tools need to be complemented by methods to determine the Fermi energy and the Fermi surface. Various schemes for broadening the distribution function around the Fermi energy are presented and the approximations involved are discussed. In order to obtain an interpretation of electronic structure calculations in terms of physics, the concepts of bandstructures and atom-projected and/or orbital-projected density of states are useful. Aspects of convergence with the number of basis functions and the number of k-points need to be addressed specifically for each physical property. The importance of this issue will be exemplified for force constant calculations and simulations of finite-temperature properties of materials. The methods developed for periodic systems carry over, with some reservations, to less symmetric situations by working with a supercell. The chapter closes with an outlook to the use of supercell calculations for surfaces and interfaces of crystals.},

The obtained enthalpy differences between the individual spin configurations were used to determine spin couplings of an Ising-like model, and subsequent Monte Carlo simulations for this model allowed the estimation of the phenomenological interaction parameter Γ of the Slichter-Drickamer model, which is commonly used to describe the cooperativity of the spin transition.

DFT+U is not on this “ladder” but rather acts as an “elevator” because it systematically tunes relative energetics, typically on a localized subshell (e.g., d or f electrons), regardless of the underlying functional employed. However, this tuning is based on a metric of the local electron density of the subshells being addressed, thus necessitating physical or chemical or intuition about the system of interest. I will provide a brief overview of the history of how DFT+U came to be starting from the origin of the Hubbard and Anderson model Hamiltonians. This history lesson is necessary because it permits us to make the connections between the “Hubbard U” and fundamental outstanding challenges in electronic structure theory, and it helps to explain why this method is so widely applied to transition-metal oxides and organometallic complexes alike.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}We present a detailed analysis of the addition-elimination reaction pathways for the gas-phase conversion of molecular hydrogen and methane on FeO+ to water and methanol, respectively, using first-principles calculations. These two reactions represent paradigmatic, challenging test cases for electronic structure approaches to transition-metal catalysis. We compare here density-functional approaches against state-of-the-art coupled-cluster and multireference quantum chemistry approaches. The quantum chemical approaches are found to be in close agreement between themselves as well as with the available experimental evidence. For the density-functional calculations, we employ a recently introduced ab initio, self-consistent Hubbard-like correction, coupled here with a generalized-gradient approximation (GGA) for the exchange-correlation functional. We find that our formulation provides a remarkable improvement in the description of the electronic structure, hybridization, and multiplet splittings for all calculated stationary points along these reaction pathways. The Hubbard term, which is not a fitting parameter and, in principle, can augment any exchange-correlation functional, brings the density-functional theory results in close agreement with the reference calculations. In particular, thermochemical errors as large as 1.4 eV in the exit channels with the GGA functional are reduced by an order of magnitude, to less than 0.1 eV on average; additionally, close agreement with the correlated-electron reference calculations and experiments are achieved for intermediate spin splittings and structures, reaction exothermicity, and spin crossovers. The role that the Hubbard U term plays in improving both quantitative and qualitative descriptions of transition-metal chemistry is examined, and its strengths as well as possible weaknesses are discussed in detail.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Going beyond the targeted search for new materials within prespecified systems, the recently developed method, Mendelevian search, allows one to look for materials with the desired properties across the entire Periodic Table, indicating possibly superhard (or other) materials that could be obtained experimentally. From this viewpoint, we discuss the recently developed methods for crystal structure prediction and empirical models of Vickers hardness and fracture toughness that allow fast screening for materials with optimal mechanical properties. We also discuss the results of the computational search for hard and superhard materials obtained in the last few years using these novel approaches and present a “treasure map” of hard and superhard materials, which summarizes known and predicted materials and points to promising future directions of superhard materials discovery.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Quantum mechanical, chemical, and topological descriptors are used to correlate each molecular structure with a conductance value, and the resulting machine-learning model can predict the corresponding value of conductance with correlation coefficients of r2=0.95 for the training set and r2=0.78 for a blind testing set. While neglecting entirely the effects of the metal contacts, this work demonstrates that single molecule conductance can be qualitatively correlated with a number of molecular descriptors through a suitably trained machine learning model. The dominant features in the machine learning model include those based on the electronic wavefunction, the geometry/topology of the molecule as well as the surface chemistry of the molecule. This model can be used to identify promising molecular structures for use in single-molecule electronic circuits and can guide synthesis and experiments in the future.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Chem. Phys. 141, 151102 (2014)], is applied to describe the van der Waals dominated Ag2/graphene interaction. It extends the dispersionless density functional theory developed by Pernal et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 263201 (2009)] by including periodic boundary conditions while the dispersion is parametrized via the method of increments [H. Stoll, J. Chem. Phys. 97, 8449 (1992)]. Starting with the elementary cluster unit of the target surface (benzene), continuing through the realistic cluster model (coronene), and ending with the periodic model of the extended system, modern ab initio methodologies for intermolecular interactions as well as state-of-the-art van der Waals-corrected density functional-based approaches are put together both to assess the accuracy of the composite scheme and to better characterize the Ag2/graphene interaction.

Using a slurry reactor, rate laws were determined for each of the manganese oxides in the hydrohalogen acids. Significant variations in the reaction rates (up to five orders of magnitude over the HCl base rate) were obtained with different acids. The addition of anions as neutral salts to acidic solutions is shown to produce the same rate-accelerating effect as acids containing that anion. The effect of the different acids on the oxide dissolution rates is explained using semiconductor band theory and energy diagrams.},

The authors’ investigations show the effects induced by UV irradiation on the water adsorption and desorption on the TiO2 surface. The observations prove that superhydrophilicity cannot be solely induced by the removal of organic contamination via photocatalysis, but is associated with water adsorption most probably due to the appearance of hydroxyl groups on surface defects.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In particular, the nature of dangling–bond–free surfaces in 2D vdW materials enables the formation of heterojunctions without the constraint of atomic lattice match. Here, we report on a 2D WSe2/MoS2 multilayer van der Waals heterojunction PN diode and its application for visible-near infrared broadband detection. The WSe2/MoS2 PN diode shows excellent performance with an ideality factor of 1.5 and a high rectification (ON/OFF) ratio of over 106. This PN diode exhibits spectral photo-responses from the ultraviolet (405 nm) region to the near infrared (808 nm) region with obvious photovoltaic behaviors (very clear open circuit voltage and short circuit current). In addition to the static behavior, photocurrent switching behaviors are clearly observed under periodic illuminations at up to 1 KHz. The device shows a linear response within the optical power density range of 10−5 W cm−2 to 1 W cm−2 and a linear dynamic range is estimated to be 123 dB.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In all cases, the functionals search for constrained minima.

Q[?] searches all antisymmetric wavefunctions ?? which yield the fixed. ?. Q[?] then delivers that expectation value which is a minimum. Similarly, [Formula: see text] is shown to be the universal functional for the electron?electron repulsion energy of an N-representable trial first-order density matrix ?, where the actual external potential may be nonlocal as well as local. These universal functions do not require that a trial function for a variational calculation be associated with a ground state of some external potential. Thus, the v-representability problem, which is especially severe for trial first-order density matrices, has been solved. Universal variational functionals in Hartree?Fock and other restricted wavefunction theories are also presented. Finally, natural spin-orbital functional theory is compared with traditional orbital formulations in density functional theory.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}We perform model calculations for a stretched LiF molecule, demonstrating that nonadiabatic charge transfer effects can be accurately and seamlessly described within a density functional framework. In alkali halides like LiF, there is an abrupt change in the ground state electronic distribution due to an electron transfer at a critical bond length R = Rc, where an avoided crossing of the lowest adiabatic potential energy surfaces calls the validity of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation into doubt. Modeling the R-dependent electronic structure of LiF within a two-site Hubbard model, we find that nonadiabatic electron-nuclear coupling produces a sizable elongation of the critical Rc by 0.5 bohr. This effect is very accurately captured by a simple and rigorously derived correction, with an M−1 prefactor, to the exchange-correlation potential in density functional theory, M = reduced nuclear mass. Since this nonadiabatic term depends on gradients of the nuclear wave function and conditional electronic density, ∇Rχ(R) and ∇Rn(r, R), it couples the Kohn-Sham equations at neighboring R points. Motivated by an observed localization of nonadiabatic effects in nuclear configuration space, we propose a local conditional density approximation—an approximation that reduces the search for nonadiabatic density functionals to the search for a single function y(n).{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Beyond calculating bandgaps, we have achieved converged absolute band-edge energies relative to the vacuum level. Compared with the results from other approaches, the GW calculation reveals substantially larger bandgaps and different absolute quasiparticle energies because of enhanced many-electron effects. Interestingly, our GW calculations ratify the band-gap-center approximation, making it a convenient way to estimate band-edge energy. The absolute band-edge energies and band offsets obtained in this work are important for designing heterojunction devices and chemical catalysts based on monolayer dichalcogenides.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Titanium nitride (TiN) films have been used as gate electrode on metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) devices. TiN effective work function (EWF) values have been often reported as suitable for pMOS. For nMOS devices, a gate electrode with sufficient low EWF value with a similar robustness as TiN is a challenge. Thus, in this work, aluminum (Al) is incorporated into the TiN layer to reduce the EWF values, which allows the use of this electrode in nMOS devices. Titanium aluminum (TiAl), Al, and aluminum nitride (AlN) layers were introduced between the high-k (HfO2) dielectric and TiN electrode as Al diffusion sources. Pt/TiN (with Al diffusion) and Pt/TiN/TiAl/TiN structures were obtained and TiN EWF values were reduced of 0.37 eV and 1.09 eV, respectively. The study of TiN/AlN/HfO2/SiO2/Si/Al structures demonstrated that AlN layer can be used as an alternative film for TiN EWF tuning. A decrease of 0.26 eV and 0.45 eV on TiN EWF values were extracted from AlN/TiN stack and AlN/TiN laminate stack, respectively. AlN/TiN laminate structures have been shown to be more effective to reduce the TiN work function than just increasing the AlN thickness.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}In the context of investigating organic molecules for molecular electronics, doping molecular wires with transition metal atoms provides additional means of controlling their transport behavior. The incorporation of transition metal atoms may generate spin dependence because the conduction channels of only one spin component align with the chemical potential of the leads, resulting in a spin polarized electric current. The possibility to create such a spin polarized current is investigated here with the organometallic moiety cobaltocene. According to our calculations, cobaltocene contacted with gold electrodes acts as a robust spin filter: Applying a voltage less than 0.2V causes the current of one spin component crossing the molecular bridge to be two orders of magnitude larger than the other. We address the key issue of sensitivity to molecule-lead geometry by showing that a weak barrier generated by CH2 groups between the cobaltocene and the leads is crucial in reducing the sensitivity to the contact geometry while only reducing the current modestly. These results suggest cobaltocene as a robust basic building block for molecular spintronics.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

By simultaneously recording the variations of both the exciton lifetime and the CL intensity across the dislocation, we directly assess the dynamics of excitons around the defect.

The type II band alignment in the BP/β-AsP vdW heterostructure is beneficial for separating the photogenerated electrons and holes and suppressing their recombination. The BP/β-AsP heterostructure not only keeps a suitable band edge position for the water splitting reaction but also significantly improves the optical absorption in the visible and ultraviolet light region. Appropriate uniaxial strain can change the indirect bandgap of the BP/β-AsP heterostructure into a direct one.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}We apply first-principles approaches with Hubbard U corrections for calculation of small molecule binding energetics to open-shell transition metal atoms in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Using density functional theory with van der Waals dispersion-corrected functionals, we determine Hubbard U values ab initio through an established linear response procedure for M-MOF-74, for a number of different metal centers (M = Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu). While our ab initio U values differ from those used in previous work, we show that they result in lattice parameters and electronic contributions to CO2-MOF binding energies that lead to excellent agreement with experiments and previous results, yielding lattice parameters within 3\%. In addition, U-dependent calculations for an example system, Co-MOF-74, suggest that the CO2 binding energy grows monotonically with the value of Hubbard U, with the binding energy shifting 4 kJ/mol (or 0.041 eV) over the range of U = 0-5.4 eV. These results provide insight into an approximate but computationally efficient means for calculation of small molecule binding energies to open-shell transition metal atoms in MOFs and suggest that the approach can be predictive with good accuracy, independent of the cations used and the availability of experimental data.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Conventional density functional theory (DFT) fails for strongly correlated electron systems due to large intra-atomic self-interaction errors. The DFT+U method provides a means of overcoming these errors through the use of a parametrized potential that employs an exact treatment of quantum mechanical exchange interactions. The parameters that enter into this potential correspond to the spherically averaged intra-atomic Coulomb (U) and exchange (J) interactions. Recently, we developed an ab initio approach for evaluating these parameters on the basis of unrestricted Hartree–Fock (UHF) theory, which has the advantage of being free of self-interaction errors and does not require experimental input [Mosey and Carter, Phys. Rev. B 76, 155123 (2007)]. In this work, we build on that method to develop a more robust and convenient ab initio approach for evaluating U and J. The new technique employs a relationship between U and J and the Coulomb and exchange integrals evaluated using the entire set of UHF molecular orbitals (MOs) for the system. Employing the entire set of UHF MOs renders the method rotationally invariant and eliminates the difficulty in selecting unambiguously the MOs that correspond to localized states. These aspects overcome two significant deficiencies of our earlier method. The new technique is used to evaluate U and J for Cr2O3, FeO, and Fe2O3. The resulting values of U-J are close to empirical estimates of this quantity for each of these materials and are also similar to results of constrained DFT calculations. DFT+U calculations using the ab initio parameters yield results that are in good agreement with experiment. As such, this method offers a means of performing accurate and fully predictive DFT+U calculations of strongly correlated electron materials.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The band edge potentials have been calculated using a recently developed approach where quasi-particle effects are taken into account through the GW approximation. First, it was found that the description of ground state properties such as cohesive and surface formation energies requires the proper treatment of dispersive interaction. Furthermore, through the analysis of calculated band-edge potentials, it is shown that g-h-triazine has high reductive power reaching the potential to reduce CO2 to formic acid, coplanar g-h-heptazine displays the highest thermodynamics force toward H2O/O2 oxidation reaction, and corrugated g-h-heptazine exhibits a good capacity for both reactions.

However, calculations with reparametrized density functionals on molecules of the thermal spin-crossover type can give improved results when compared with experiment for close-lying states of different spin and are therefore important for, e.g., transition metal catalysis. A classification of transition metal compounds within hybrid density functional theory is given to distinguish standard, critical, and complicated cases.

The thicker junctions (100 and 200 nm) exhibit rectifying behavior and a reproducible drop of their electrical resistance by ca. 65–80\% when switching the molecules from the high-spin to the low-spin state. This current modulation is ascribed to a bulk-limited charge transport mechanism via a thermally activated hopping process.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Hubbard corrected density functional theory (DFT) methods, such as the DFT+U approach in Dudarev’s approximation, are widely used for the description of energetics and electronic structure of strongly correlated materials, providing higher level of accuracy than local DFT calculations (e.g., local density approximation or generalized gradient approximation). However, the DFT+U method in Dudarev’s formulation limits the introduced corrections to interactions between the electrons within the same spin channel, whereas interactions between the electrons with opposite spins are still treated using local DFT functional (e.g., Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof). In recent years, the need for correction of these interactions between the electrons with opposite spins has been recognized and additional terms have been added to the Hubbard term to reflect it. Although such extended DFT+U functionals have been proposed, the form of respective Hamiltonian operator, defined as a total energy derivative over density with appropriate treatment of double counting corrections due to additional Hubbard terms, has not been explicitly presented. In this work, we provide an expression for such a type of Hamiltonian, which contains the respective double counting correction contributions. This formulation also allows evaluation of atomic forces, using computational settings discussed herein. In addition, we also introduce adjustments for too narrow theoretical bandgaps, using scissor operator technique. This allows for a greater level of corrections of energetics and magnetic properties of studied transition metal compounds, avoiding possible unphysical overlap between occupied and unoccupied electronic bands.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The current approach can be viewed as an extension to our previous work on stochastic resolution of identity second order Møller-Plesset perturbation theory [T. Y. Takeshita et al., J. Chem. Theory Comput. 13, 4605 (2017)] and offers an alternative to previous stochastic GF2 formulations [D. Neuhauser et al., J. Chem. Theory Comput. 13, 5396 (2017)]. We show that sRI-GF2 recovers the deterministic GF2 results for small systems, is computationally faster than deterministic GF2 for N \&amp;gt; 80, and is a practical approach to describe weak correlations in systems with 103 electrons and more.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

It is shown that, particularly in anions, electronic correlations play a crucial role; these effects are not systematically captured with any commonly used DFT functionals such as gradient corrected, hybrids, and range-separated hybrids. On the other hand, tightly bound cations can be described qualitatively by DFT. A comparison of DFT and quantum Monte Carlo provides an in-depth understanding of the electronic structure and properties of these correlated systems.

We use quantum mechanical calculations based on density functional theory to study the effect of ripplocations on the structural and electronic properties of single-layer MoS2, and, in particular, the coupling between these extended defects and the most common defects in this material, S-vacancies. We find that the formation of neutral S-vacancies is energetically more favorable in the ripplocation. In addition, we demonstrate that ripplocations alone do not introduce electronic states into the intrinsic bandgap, in contrast to S-vacancies. We study the dependence of the induced gap states on the position of the defects in the ripplocation, which has implications for the experimental characterization of MoS2 flakes and the engineering of quantum emitters in this material. Our specific findings collectively aim to provide insights into the electronic structure of experimentally relevant defects in MoS2 and to establish structure-property relationships for the design of MoS2-based quantum devices.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The local and long range structural measurements were complemented by ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. With respect to the Mn sites in YMnO3 and HoMnO3, we find no large atomic (bond distances or thermal factors), electronic structure changes, or rehybridization on crossing TFE from local structural methods. The local symmetry about the Mn sites is preserved. With respect to the local structure about the Ho sites, a reduction of the average Ho–O bond with increased temperature is found. Ab initio molecular dynamics calculations on HoMnO3 reveal the detailed motions of all ions. Above ∼900 K there are large displacements of the Ho, O3, and O4 ions along the z axis which reduce the buckling of the MnO3/O4 planes. The changes result in O3/O4 ions moving to toward central points between pairs of Ho ions on the z axis. These structural changes make the coordination of Ho sites more symmetric thus extinguishing the electric polarization. At significantly higher temperatures, rotation of the MnO5 polyhedra occurs without a significant change in electric polarization. The Born effective charge tensor is found to be highly anisotropic at the O sites but does not change appreciably at high temperatures.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The present paper reports the application of a computational framework, based on the quantum master equation, the Fermi’s golden Rule, and conventional wavefunction-based methods, to describe electron transport through a spin crossover molecular junction (Fe(bapbpy) (NCS)2, 1, bapbpy = N-(6-(6-(Pyridin-2-ylamino)pyridin-2-yl)pyridin-2-yl)-pyridin-2-amine). This scheme is an alternative to the standard approaches based on the relative position and nature of the frontier orbitals, as it evaluates the junction’s Green’s function by means of accurate state energies and wavefunctions. In the present work, those elements are calculated for the relevant states of the high- and low-spin species of 1, and they are used to evaluate the output conductance within a given range of bias- and gate-voltages. The contribution of the ground and low-lying excited states to the current is analyzed, and inspected in terms of their 2S + 1 Ms-states. In doing so, it is shown the relevance of treating not only the ground state in its maximum-Ms projection, as usually done in most computational-chemistry packages, but the whole spectrum of low-energy states of the molecule. Such improved representation of the junction has a notable impact on the total conductivity and, more importantly, it restores the equivalence between alpha and beta transport, which means that no spin polarization is observed in the absence of Zeeman splitting. Finally, this work inspects the strong- and weak-points of the suggested theoretical framework to understand electron transport through molecular switchable materials, identifies a pathway for future improvement, and offers a new insight into concepts that play a key role in spintronics.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

However, SCO systems face several bottlenecks when downscaling into nanoscale spintronic devices: their instability at the nanoscale, their insulating character and the lack of control when positioning nanocrystals in nanodevices. Here we show the encapsulation of robust Fe-based SCO molecules within the 1D cavities of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT). We find that the SCO mechanism endures encapsulation and positioning of individual heterostructures in nanoscale transistors. The SCO switch in the guest molecules triggers a large conductance bistability through the host SWCNT. Moreover, the SCO transition shifts to higher temperatures and displays hysteresis cycles, and thus memory effect, not present in crystalline samples. Our results demonstrate how encapsulation in SWCNTs provides the backbone for the readout and positioning of SCO molecules into nanodevices, and can also help to tune their magnetic properties at the nanoscale.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Materials with open-shell d or f-electrons are of great importance for their intriguing electronic, optical, and magnetic properties. Often termed as strongly correlated systems, they pose great challenges for first-principles studies based on density-functional theory (DFT) in the local density approximation or generalized gradient approximation (GGA). The DFT plus the Hubbard U correction (DFT + U) approach, which is widely used in first-principles studies of strongly correlated systems, depends on the local Coulomb interaction parameters (the Hubbard U and the Hund exchange J) that are often chosen empirically, which significantly limits its predictive capability. In this work, we propose a local screened Coulomb correction (LSCC) approach in which the on-site Coulomb interaction parameters are determined by the local electron density based on the Thomas-Fermi screening model in a system-dependent and self-consistent way. The LSCC approach is applied to several typical strongly correlated systems (MnO, FeO, CoO, NiO, β-MnO2, K2CuF4, KCuF3, KNiF3, La2CuO4, NiF2, MnF2, KMnF3, K2NiF4, La2NiO4, and Sr2CuO2Cl2), and the results are compared to those obtained from the hybrid functional and GGA methods. We found that the LSCC method can provide an accurate description of electronic and magnetic properties of considered strongly correlated systems and its performance is less sensitive to the effective range of the local projection than the closely related DFT + U approach. Therefore, the LSCC approach provides a parameter-free first-principles approach to strongly correlated systems.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The half-life of the OLEDs stressed under a high current density of 100 mA/cm2 varied in a wide range, revealing an important role of the host. Pulsed current stressing with a 1\% duty cycle was performed to suppress self-heating, but only extended the lifetime by 2–3.2×. For blue OLEDs with a host favoring hole transport, current stressing caused a shift of the recombination zone toward the anode, turning the emission color to greenish blue. These results suggest that device degradation was mainly caused by charge-trapping defects generated within a narrow zone close to the electron-transport layer. It is expected that the lifetime of blue phosphorescent OLEDs can be effectively extended by selecting an appropriate host which has good stability, enables efficient charge injection and balanced charge transport in the emissive layer.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, we probe the electronic structures of single layer MoS2 on graphite. The apparent quasiparticle energy gap of single layer MoS2 is measured to be 2.15 ± 0.06 eV at 77 K, albeit a higher second conduction band threshold at 0.2 eV above the apparent conduction band minimum is also observed. Combining it with photoluminescence studies, we deduce an exciton binding energy of 0.22 ± 0.1 eV (or 0.42 eV if the second threshold is use), a value that is lower than current theoretical predictions. Consistent with theoretical predictions, we directly observe metallic edge states of single layer MoS2. In the bulk region of MoS2, the Fermi level is located at 1.8 eV above the valence band maximum, possibly due to the formation of a graphite/MoS2 heterojunction. At the edge, however, we observe an upward band bending of 0.6 eV within a short depletion length of about 5 nm, analogous to the phenomena of Fermi level pinning of a 3D semiconductor by metallic surface states},

However, any real application of photoswitchable molecules requires that spin crossover be paired with additional functionality such as long-range magnetic order. Important advances combining these functions are notably reported for a number of bimetallic Prussian Blue analogues; however, to date, PBA-based magnetic photoswitches can only operate below 150 K due to loss of magnetic order. In contrast, cobalt ferrite is a ferrimagnetic semiconductor with a Curie temperature of 790 K and extremely favorable magnetic properties by comparison to state-of-the-art PBAs. The mixed valence electronic structure of cobalt ferrite is reminiscent of cobalt–iron PBA, which is a well-known photoswitch.

Using Molecular dynamics simulations, we developed MoS2 force field parameters to reproduce the experimentally determined water contact angle of the MoS2 nanosheet and then predicted the slip-length of water that has not been measured in experiment yet. Simulation results suggest that the MoS2 nanosheet is a hydrophobic and low-friction surface, despite its seemingly significant charges of surface atoms and relatively strong strength of van der Waals potentials. We expect that the developed force fields for depicting surface atoms of MoS2 will facilitate future research in understanding biomolecule-MoS2 interactions in MoS2-based biosensors.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}We present a systematic study of a recently developed ab initio simulation scheme based on molecular dynamics and quantum Monte Carlo. In this approach, a damped Langevin molecular dynamics is employed by using a statistical evaluation of the forces acting on each atom by means of quantum Monte Carlo. This allows the use of an highly correlated wave function parametrized by several variational parameters and describing quite accurately the Born-Oppenheimer energy surface, as long as these parameters are determined at the minimum energy condition. However, in a statistical method both the minimization method and the evaluation of the atomic forces are affected by the statistical noise. In this work, we study systematically the accuracy and reliability of this scheme by targeting the vibrational frequencies of simple molecules such as the water monomer, hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide, ammonia, and phosphine. We show that all sources of systematic errors can be controlled and reliable frequencies can be obtained with a reasonable computational effort. This work provides convincing evidence that this molecular dynamics scheme can be safely applied also to realistic systems containing several atoms.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Our setup describes a molecular rotor, where one cyclopentadienyl (Cp) ring of the ferrocene molecule is fixed by the two electrodes, while the second ring is able to rotate. For small enough rotation energies the barrier between the eclipsed and staggered conformations of the ferrocene molecule ensures the functionality of a molecular oscillator. The changes in the transmission function introduced by the relative rotation angle between the two Cp rings are analyzed in both linear and non-linear bias regimes. For larger rotation energies, the device works in the spinning mode. The real time behavior of the nanomechanical device is investigated using DFT-based molecular dynamics, which shows its feasibility for applications in the terahertz regime. In the oscillating mode the natural frequencies are determined, while the spinning mode shows a remarkably reliable behavior with increasing rotation energy.},

The spin valve shows behavior similar to a magnetic tunnel junction though the nonmagnetic spacer layer (∼100nm) is much thicker than the tunneling limit. They attribute this behavior to the formation of a thin spin-selective tunneling interface between LSMO and RRP3HT caused by RRP3HT, chemically attaching to LSMO as observed by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurement. This gives rise to ∼80\% magnetoresistance (MR) at 5K and ∼1.5\% MR at room temperature. They found that by introducing monolayer of different organic insulators between LSMO and RRP3HT the spin-selective interface is destroyed and the spin injection is reduced. Their results show that organic materials are promising candidates for spintronic applications.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Spin crossover compounds are multifunctional switching materials that change their spin state and many other physical properties, such as colour, magnetic susceptibility, electric conductivity, dielectric constant and mechanical properties, upon external stimuli. Spin crossover materials have been proposed for a variety of technological applications that require the elaboration of highly controlled thin films and patterns. Here, we present a brief overview of the most diffused approaches for thin film growth and patterning, showing both conventional and unconventional approaches and the most recent advancement in their applications, highlighting the most promising cases and the most critical problems.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Various methods going beyond density functional theory (DFT), such as DFT+U, hybrid functionals, meta-GGAs, GW, and DFT-embedded dynamical mean field theory (eDMFT), have been developed to describe the electronic structure of correlated materials, but it is unclear how accurate these methods can be expected to be when applied to a given strongly correlated solid. It is thus of pressing interest to compare their accuracy as they apply to different categories of materials. Here we introduce a novel paradigm in which a chosen set of beyond-DFT methods is systematically and uniformly tested on a chosen class of materials. For a first application, we choose the target materials to be the binary transition metal oxides FeO, CoO, MnO, and NiO in their antiferromagnetic phase and present a head-to-head comparison of spectral properties as computed using the various methods. We also compare with available experimental angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), inverse-photoemission spectroscopy, and with optical absorption. For the class of compounds studied here, we find that both B3LYP and eDMFT reproduce the experiments quite well, with eDMFT doing best, in particular when comparing with the ARPES data.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The light-induced spin-state switching of the molecules from the ground low spin to the metastable high spin state at 10 K led to a well-reproducible shift of the cantilever's resonance frequency (Δfr = −0.52 Hz). Control experiments at different temperatures using coated as well as uncoated devices along with simple calculations support the assignment of this effect to the spin transition. This latter translates into changes in mechanical behavior of the cantilever due to the strong spin-state/lattice coupling. A guideline for the optimization of device parameters is proposed so as to efficiently harness molecular scale movements for large-scale mechanical work, thus paving the road for nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) actuators based on molecular materials.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Calculated results illustrate a distinctive dependence of thermal transfer on the details of interfacial microstructures. More specifically, the chemisorbed case with a stronger bonding exhibits a generally smaller interfacial thermal resistance than the physisorbed. Comparison between metal/MoS2 and metal/graphene systems suggests that metal/MoS2 is significantly more resistive. Further examination of lattice dynamics identifies the presence of multiple distinct atomic planes and bonding patterns at the interface as the key origins of the observed large thermal resistance.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Therefore, an in-depth understanding of the thermal, optical, and electron induced reaction pathways is required. Here, the electrophilic DNA nucleobase analog 5-Bromouracil (BrU) has been used as a model compound to study its decomposition in the vicinity of AuNPs illuminated with intense ns laser pulses under various conditions. The plasmonic response of the AuNPs and the concentration of BrU and resulting photoproducts have been tracked by ultraviolet and visible (UV–Vis) spectroscopy as a function of the irradiation time. A kinetic model has been developed to determine the reaction rates of two parallel fragmentation pathways of BrU, and their dependency on laser fluence and adsorption on the AuNP have been evaluated. In addition, the size and the electric field enhancement of the decomposed AuNPs have been determined by atomic force microscopy and finite domain time difference calculations, respectively. A minor influence of the direct photoreaction and a strong effect of the heating of the AuNPs have been revealed. However, due to the size reduction of the irradiated AuNPs, a trade-off between laser fluence and plasmonic response of the AuNPs has been observed. Hence, the decomposition of the AuNPs might be limiting the achievable temperatures under irradiation with several laser pulses. These findings need to be considered for an efficient design of catalytic plasmonic systems.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Using ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) calculations, we investigate the role of the van der Waals (vdW) interaction in the dissociative adsorption of N2 on W(110). Hitherto, existing classical dynamics calculations performed on six-dimensional potential energy surfaces based on density functional theory (DFT), and the semi-local PW91 and RPBE [Hammer et al. Phys. Rev. B 59, 7413 (1999)] exchange-correlation functionals were unable to fully describe the dependence of the initial sticking coefficient on the molecular beam incidence conditions as found in experiments. N2 dissociation on W(110) was shown to be very sensitive not only to short molecule-surface distances but also to large distances where the vdW interaction, not included in semilocal-DFT, should dominate. In this work, we perform a systematic study on the dissociative adsorption using a selection of existing non-local functionals that include the vdW interaction (vdW-functionals). Clearly, the inclusion of the non-local correlation term contributes in all cases to correct the unrealistic energy barriers that were identified in the RPBE at large molecule-surface distances. Among the tested vdW-functionals, the original vdW-DF by Dion et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 246401 (2004)] and the ulterior vdW-DF2 give also an adequate description of the N2 adsorption energy and energy barrier at the transition state, i.e., of the properties that are commonly used to verify the quality of any exchange-correlation functional. However, the results of our AIMD calculations, which are performed at different incidence conditions and hence extensively probe the multi-configurational potential energy surface of the system, do not seem as satisfactory as the preliminary static analysis suggested. When comparing the obtained dissociation probabilities with existing experimental data, none of the used vdW-functionals seems to provide altogether an adequate description of the N2/W(110) interaction at short and large distances.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

A fully quantum mechanical treatment of the interface is computationally demanding due to the large number of degrees of freedom involved. In this work, we develop a computationally efficient model where the electrode part of the interface is described at the density-functional theory (DFT) level, and the electrolyte part is represented through an implicit solvation model based on the Poisson-Boltzmann equation. We describe the implementation of the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation into the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package, a widely used DFT code, followed by validation and benchmarking of the method. To demonstrate the utility of the implicit electrolyte model, we apply it to study the surface energy of Cu crystal facets in an aqueous electrolyte as a function of applied electric potential. We show that the applied potential enables the control of the shape of nanocrystals from an octahedral to a truncated octahedral morphology with increasing potential.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The transmission of electrons in the bimetallocene connected to two gold electrodes was calculated using a first-principles density functional method. Spin transport was estimated from the difference between the transmissions of the spin-up and spin-down states. Results revealed that bicobaltocene has a perfect spin-filtering effect because the supply of excess electrons to the electronic state of ferrocene causes a split in the energy levels of the spin-up and spin-down states. As surmised, it was found that spin polarization was caused by strong interactions between the two metal centers via the fulvalene ligand.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}A correct description of electronic exchange and correlation effects for molecules in contact with extended (metal) surfaces is a challenging task for first-principles modeling. In this work, we demonstrate the importance of collective van der Waals dispersion effects beyond the pairwise approximation for organic–inorganic systems on the example of atoms, molecules, and nanostructures adsorbed on metals. We use the recently developed many-body dispersion (MBD) approach in the context of density-functional theory [Tkatchenko et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 236402 (2012) and Ambrosetti et al., J. Chem. Phys. 140, 18A508 (2014)] and assess its ability to correctly describe the binding of adsorbates on metal surfaces. We briefly review the MBD method and highlight its similarities to quantum-chemical approaches to electron correlation in a quasiparticle picture. In particular, we study the binding properties of xenon, 3,4,9,10-perylene-tetracarboxylic acid, and a graphene sheet adsorbed on the Ag(111) surface. Accounting for MBD effects, we are able to describe changes in the anisotropic polarizability tensor, improve the description of adsorbate vibrations, and correctly capture the adsorbate–surface interaction screening. Comparison to other methods and experiment reveals that inclusion of MBD effects improves adsorption energies and geometries, by reducing the overbinding typically found in pairwise additive dispersion-correction approaches.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The availability of promising candidate materials has enabled much of the progress in this field. Here, I present my perspective on the development of cleavable magnetic materials with a focus on transition metal halides and chalcogenides and an emphasis on crystal structure and magnetic order. To give proper context for these discussions, brief and incomplete surveys of recent work are included, focusing on specific aspects that I find most useful for guiding work on emerging materials and motivating expansion into other compounds and material families. Several instances of structural changes that can differentiate behaviors of bulk and ultrathin specimens are noted. Probing and understanding potential structural differences present a challenge but also an opportunity for material and device development, if they can be predicted and controlled. It is clear that careful investigations of structure, layer stacking, and defects in materials, how they may relate to the crystal chemistry, and how they may be different in crystals and mono- or few-layer specimens provide invaluable context for understanding the behavior of van der Waals layered magnetic materials.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Extensive studies have shown that the measurement of p-type conduction in InN epilayers has been fundamentally limited by the presence of electron accumulation on the c-plane surfaces. In contrast, the nonpolar grown surfaces of InN are found to be completely free of electron accumulation. Moreover, through direct Mg dopant incorporation, the surfaces (nonpolar m-plane) of InN nanowires can be transformed from intrinsic to nearly p-type degenerate, which has led to the first direct measurement of p-type conduction in InN.},

In c-direction, depending on the surface termination III-nitrides have either a group III element (Al, In, Ga) polarity or a N-polarity. Currently, commercially available GaN-based electronic and optoelectronic devices are fabricated predominantly on Ga-polar GaN. However, N-polar nitride heterostructures due its intrinsic material properties, including opposite polarization field and more chemically reactive surface, can provide benefits for these applications. In this article, some of important electronic and optical properties of N-polar (In, Ga, Al)N thin films and heterostructures have been reviewed. Different techniques that have been used for the epitaxial growth of these materials including tri-halide vapor phase epitaxy (THVPE), metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), and plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy (PAMBE) have been discussed. Finally, some of important process technologies that have been developed for fabrication of N-polar GaN high electron mobility transistors are presented.},

The algorithm relies on the Hellmann-Feynman theorem and incorporates Pulay corrections in the presence of atomic orbital basis sets. We benchmark the method for small molecules by comparing the computed forces with the derivatives of the AFQMC potential energy surface and by direct comparison with other quantum chemistry methods. We then perform geometry optimizations using the steepest descent algorithm in larger molecules. With realistic basis sets, we obtain equilibrium geometries in agreement, within statistical error bars, with experimental values. The increase in computational cost for computing forces in this approach is only a small prefactor over that of calculating the total energy. This paves the way for a general and efficient approach for geometry optimization and molecular dynamics within AFQMC.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Surface potential mapping at the MoS $_{\textrm{2}}$ /GaN heterojunction is done using Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy to measure the conduction band offset. Current-voltage measurements show a diode like behavior of the heterojunction. The origin of diode like behavior is attributed to unique type II band alignment of the heterojunction. The photocurrent, photoresponsivity and detectivity of the heterojunction are found to be dependent on power density of the light. Photoresponse investigations reveal that the heterojunction is highly sensitive to 405 nm laser with very high responsivity up to 10 $^{\textrm{5}}$  A/W. The heterojunction also shows very high detectivity of the order of 10 $^{\textrm{14}}$ Jones. Moreover, the device shows photoresponse in UV region also.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The evaluation of exact exchange (EXX) is an important component of quantum chemical calculations performed with ab initio and hybrid density functional methods. While evaluating exact exchange is routine in molecular quantum chemical calculations performed with localized basis sets, the non-local nature of the exchange operator presents a major impediment to the efficient use of exact exchange in calculations that employ planewave basis sets. Non-orthogonal generalized Wannier functions (NGWFs) corresponding to planewave expansions of localized basis functions are an alternative form of basis set that can be used in quantum chemical calculations. The periodic nature of these functions renders them suitable for calculations of periodic systems, while the contraction of sets of planewaves into individual basis functions reduces the number of variational parameters, permitting the construction and direct diagonalization of the Fock matrix. The present study examines how NGWFs corresponding to Fourier series representations of conventional atom-centered basis sets can be used to evaluate exact exchange in periodic systems. Specifically, an approach for constructing the exchange operator with NGWFs is presented and used to perform Hartree-Fock calculations with a series of molecules in periodically repeated simulation cells. The results demonstrate that the NGWF approach is significantly faster than the EXX method, which is a standard approach for evaluating exact exchange in periodic systems.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The matrix representation of this model is isomorphic to an unoriented vertex adjacency matrix of a bipartite graph, which is also the Laplacian matrix plus twice the identity. In this paper, we analytically calculate the determinant and, when it exists, the inverse of this matrix in connection with the Green’s function, G, of the N×N Hückel matrix. A corollary is a closed form expression for a Harmonic sum (Eq. (12)). We then extend the results to d− dimensional lattices, whose linear size is N. The existence of the inverse becomes a question of number theory. We prove a new theorem in number theory pertaining to vanishing sums of cosines and use it to prove that the inverse exists if and only if N + 1 and d are odd and d is smaller than the smallest divisor of N + 1. We corroborate our results by demonstrating the entry patterns of the Green’s function and discuss applications related to transport and conductivity.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Our analysis demonstrates how ideas from functional group chemistry may be used to engineer a molecule’s transport properties, as was shown experimentally and using a semiempirical model for BDA [Nano Lett. 7, 502 (2007)]. In particular, we show that the qualitative change in conductance due to a given functional group can be predicted from its known electronic effect (whether it is σ∕π donating/withdrawing). However, the influence of functional groups on a molecule’s conductance is very weak, as was also found in the BDA experiments. The calculated DFT conductances for the BDA species are five times larger than the experimental values, but good agreement is obtained after correcting for self-interaction and image charge effects.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Some aspects of employing different electronic structure methods to obtain information about potential energy surfaces and interstate couplings for NAMD simulations are also discussed.

GaN, as wide bandgap materials (WBG) has demonstrated superior material properties such as improved thermal conductivity and excellent electrical properties, has become an attractive candidate for the next generation of high-power and high-frequency applications. The occurrence of the two- dimensional electron gas (2DEG) channel at AlGaN/GaN heterostructures interface makes GaN HEMTs intrinsically Normally-on devices. However, the Normally-off operation is often desired in many power electronics applications. Several methods had been explained to obtain Normally-off devices. Therefore, Normally-off GaN-based HEMTs with a p-GaN gate method is among the most promising and the only commercially available today. First, this paper would summarize the physical properties and device performance of GaN material over Silicon (Si) and Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) and related to other WBG material. Then, a normally-on and normally-off configuration are explored. After that, the most relevant technological issues for normally-off HEMTs focusing on the p-GaN gate are discussed. Finally, the p-GaN interfaceÃ¢ÂÂs role and the impact of the thermal processes on the electrical characteristics are widely discussed.},

Approximate exchange-correlation functionals struggle with such systems, leading to pervasive delocalization and static correlation errors. We demonstrate how these errors, which plague density-functional calculations of bond-stretching processes, can be avoided by employing the alternative framework of partition density-functional theory (PDFT) even using the local density approximation for the fragments. Our method is illustrated with explicit calculations on simple systems exhibiting delocalization and static-correlation errors, stretched H2+, H2, He2+, Li2+, and Li2. In all these cases, our method leads to greatly improved dissociation-energy curves. The effective KS potential corresponding to our self-consistent solutions displays key features around the bond midpoint; these are known to be present in the exact KS potential, but are absent from most approximate KS potentials and are essential for the correct description of electron dynamics.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The zero-field splitting (ZFS) (expressed in terms of the D tensor) is the leading spin-Hamiltonian parameter for systems with a ground state spin S\&amp;gt;1∕2. To first order in perturbation theory, the ZFS arises from the direct spin-spin dipole-dipole interaction. To second order, contributions arise from spin-orbit coupling (SOC). The latter contributions are difficult to treat since the SOC mixes states of different multiplicities. This is an aspect of dominant importance for the correct prediction of the D tensor. In this work, the theory of the D tensor is discussed from the point of view of analytic derivative theory. Starting from a general earlier perturbation treatment [F. Neese and E. I. Soloman, Inorg. Chem. 37, 6568 (1998)], straightforward response equations are derived that are readily transferred to the self-consistent field (SCF) Hartree-Fock (HF) or density functional theory (DFT) framework. The main additional effort in such calculations arises from the solution of nine sets of nonstandard coupled-perturbed SCF equations. These equations have been implemented together with the spin-orbit mean-field representation of the SOC operator and a mean-field treatment of the direct spin-spin interaction into the ORCA electronic structure program. A series of test calculations on diatomic molecules with accurately known zero-field splittings shows that the new approach corrects most of the shortcomings of previous DFT based methods and, on average, leads to predictions within 10\% of the experimental values. The slope of the correlation line is essentially unity for the B3LYP and BLYP functionals compared to ∼0.5 in previous treatments.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We predict that a concentration of up to 20\% Cu and Mn into β-Mn2V2O7 and β-Cu2V2O7, respectively, leads to a narrowing of the bandgap, which, in the former case, is experimentally confirmed by UV–vis spectroscopy. Calculations in the intermediate composition range, however, yield nearly constant bandgaps. Moreover, we predict the materials with higher substitution levels to be increasingly difficult to synthesize, implying that low substitution levels are most relevant in terms of bandgaps and ease of synthesis.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Spin crossover materials are bi-stable systems with potential applications as molecular scale electronic switches, actuators, thermometers, barometers, and displays. However, calculating the enthalpy difference, ΔH, between the high spin and low spin states has been plagued with difficulties. For example, many common density functional theory (DFT) methods fail to even predict the correct sign of ΔH, which determines the low temperature state. Here, we study a collection of Fe(II) and Fe(III) materials, where ΔH has been measured, which has previously been used to benchmark density functionals. The best performing hybrid functional, TPSSh, achieves a mean absolute error compared to experiment of 11 kJ mol−1 for this set of materials. However, hybrid functionals scale badly in the solid state; therefore, local functionals are preferable for studying crystalline materials, where the most interesting spin crossover phenomena occur. We show that both the Liechtenstein and Dudarev DFT+U methods are a little more accurate than TPSSh. The Dudarev method yields a mean absolute error of 8 kJ mol−1 for Ueff = 1.6 eV. However, the mean absolute error for both TPSSh and DFT+U is dominated by a single material, for which the two theoretical methods predict similar enthalpy differences—if this is excluded from the set, then DFT+U achieves chemical accuracy. Thus, DFT+U is an attractive option for calculating the properties of spin crossover crystals, as its accuracy is comparable to that of meta-hybrid functionals, but at a much lower computational cost.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Various different xc-kernels, which are all rooted in the homogeneous electron gas, are introduced but hereafter we focus on the specific class of renormalized adiabatic kernels, in particular the rALDA and rAPBE. The kernels drastically improve the description of short-range correlations as compared to the random phase approximation (RPA), resulting in significantly better correlation energies. This effect greatly reduces the reliance on error cancellations, which is essential in RPA, and systematically improves covalent bond energies while preserving the good performance of the RPA for dispersive interactions. For quasiparticle energies, the xc-kernels account for vertex corrections that are missing in the GW self-energy. In this context, we show that the short-range correlations mainly correct the absolute band positions while the band gap is less affected in agreement with the known good performance of GW for the latter. The renormalized xc-kernels offer a rigorous extension of the RPA and GW methods with clear improvements in terms of accuracy at little extra computational cost.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We also show that the BSE improves the correlation energies obtained within RPA and TDHF significantly for intermediate binding distances. A Hubbard model for the dimer allows us to obtain exact analytical results for the various approximations, which is readily compared with the exact diagonalization of the model. Moreover, the model is shown to reproduce all the qualitative results from the ab initio calculations and confirms that BSE greatly improves the RPA and TDHF results despite the fact that the BSE excitation spectrum breaks down in the dissociation limit. In contrast, second order screened exchange gives a poor description of the dissociation limit, which can be attributed to the fact that it cannot be derived from an irreducible response function.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {This paper is concerned with the interpretation of experimental data on free exciton energies in GaN epitaxial films grown on various substrates (sapphire, SiC and GaN). In hexagonal (wurtzite) films the degeneracy in the valence band is completely lifted and three excitons can be observed by reflectivity and photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy. Their energies can be interpreted in terms of the quasi-cubic model of Hopfield which involves two parameters, the spin - orbit splitting and the axial crystal field energy, which may, in principle, be derived from measurement of the energy differences and . In practice, experimental data show considerable variation; this variation is thought to be due to strain in the films introduced as a result of differential thermal expansion during cool-down from the growth temperature to room temperature, and direct calculation of the spin - orbit and crystal field parameters for each sample results in apparently random values. In particular, the values of obtained differ considerably from that measured (unambiguously) on a cubic (zinc blende) film, meV. We show that it is possible to resolve these dificulties, following an idea introduced by Gil et al (1995), by plotting and aginst for the various samples and obtaining a fit to the data thus displayed. We then find that an excellent fit can be obtained using the quasi-cubic model with meV and ranging from 13 meV to 37 meV over the range of samples for which appropriate data have been published.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} X-ray absorption spectroscopy investigations of the spin-state switching of spin-crossover (SCO) complexes adsorbed on a highly-oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) surface have shown so far that HOPG is a promising candidate to realize applications such as spintronic devices because of the stability of SCO complexes on HOPG and the possibility of highly efficient thermal and light-induced spin-state switching. Herein, we present the spin switching of several Fe(II) SCO complexes adsorbed on an HOPG surface with particular emphasis on the thermally induced spin transition behaviour with respect to different structural modifications. The complexes of the type [Fe(bpz) $_{\textrm{2}}$ (L)] (bpz  =  dihydrobis(pyrazolyl)borate, L  =  1,10-phenanthroline, 2,2′-bipyridine) and their methylated derivatives exhibit SCO in the solid state with some differences regarding cooperative effects. However, in the vacuum-deposited thick films on quartz, complete and more gradual spin transition behavior is observable via UV/ {\textless}italic{\textgreater}vis{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} spectroscopy. In contrast to that, all complexes show large differences upon direct contact with HOPG. Whereas the unmodified complexes show thermal and light-induced SCO, the addition of e.g. two or four methyl groups leads to a partial or a complete loss of the SCO on the surface. The angle-dependent measurement of the N K-edge compared to calculations indicates that the complete SCO and HS-locked molecules on the surface exhibit a similar preferential orientation, whereas complexes undergoing an incomplete SCO exhibit a random orientation on the surface. These results are discussed in the light of molecule-substrate interactions. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

For periodic systems, however, the long-range nature of the Fock exchange interaction and the resultant large computational requirements present a major drawback. This is especially true for metallic systems, which require a dense Brillouin zone sampling. Recently, a new hybrid functional [HSE03, J. Heyd, G. E. Scuseria, and M. Ernzerhof, J. Chem. Phys. 118, 8207 (2003)] that addresses this problem within the context of methods that evaluate the Fock exchange in real space was introduced. We discuss the advantages the HSE03 functional brings to methods that rely on a reciprocal space description of the Fock exchange interaction, e.g., all methods that use plane wave basis sets. Furthermore, we present a detailed comparison of the performance of the HSE03 and PBE0 functionals for a set of archetypical solid state systems by calculating lattice parameters, bulk moduli, heats of formation, and band gaps. The results indicate that the hybrid functionals indeed often improve the description of these properties, but in several cases the results are not yet on par with standard gradient corrected functionals. This concerns in particular metallic systems for which the bandwidth and exchange splitting are seriously overestimated.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The B3LYP hybrid functional has shown to successfully predict a wide range of molecular properties. For periodic systems, however, the failure to attain the exact homogeneous electron gas limit as well as the semiempirical construction turns out to be a major drawback of the functional. We rigorously assess the B3LYP functional for solids through calculations of lattice parameters, bulk moduli, and thermochemical properties (atomization energies and reaction energies). The theoretical lattice constants overestimate the experimental ones by approximately 1\%, and hence behave similarly to the PBE gradient-corrected exchange-correlation functional. B3LYP atomization energies of solids are drastically worse than those of nonempirical hybrid Hartree-Fock/density functionals (HF/DFT) such as PBE0 and HSE03. These large errors can be traced back to the lack of a proper description of “free-electron-like” systems with a significant itinerant character (metals and small gap semiconductors). Similar calculations using the popular semiempirical B3PW91 hybrid functional, which fulfills the uniform electron gas limit, show a clear improvement over B3LYP regarding atomization energies. Finally, theoretical values for heats of formation for both the B3LYP as well as the B3PW91 functionals are presented. These document a most likely fortuitously good agreement with experiment for the B3LYP hybrid functional.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}In this article, we present a new microscopic theoretical approach to the description of spin crossover in molecular crystals. The spin crossover crystals under consideration are composed of molecular fragments formed by the spin-crossover metal ion and its nearest ligand surrounding and exhibiting well defined localized (molecular) vibrations. As distinguished from the previous models of this phenomenon, the developed approach takes into account the interaction of spin-crossover ions not only with the phonons but also a strong coupling of the electronic shells with molecular modes. This leads to an effective coupling of the local modes with phonons which is shown to be responsible for the cooperative spin transition accompanied by the structural reorganization. The transition is characterized by the two order parameters representing the mean values of the products of electronic diagonal matrices and the coordinates of the local modes for the high- and low-spin states of the spin crossover complex. Finally, we demonstrate that the approach provides a reasonable explanation of the observed spin transition in the [Fe(ptz)6](BF4)2 crystal. The theory well reproduces the observed abrupt low-spin → high-spin transition and the temperature dependence of the high-spin fraction in a wide temperature range as well as the pronounced hysteresis loop. At the same time within the limiting approximations adopted in the developed model, the evaluated high-spin fraction vs. T shows that the cooperative spin-lattice transition proves to be incomplete in the sense that the high-spin fraction does not reach its maximum value at high temperature.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}A comprehensive theoretical study of the magnetic exchange between Co2+ ions is reported. Using the microscopic background we deduce the general Hamiltonian for a corner shared bioctahedral system involving kinetic exchange, spin–orbit coupling, and low-symmetry local crystal field. This Hamiltonian acting within the orbitally degenerate ground manifold (4T1g)A⊗(4T1g)B of the cobalt pair is expressed in terms of orbital and spin operators. The treatment of the Hamiltonian is performed with the use of the irreducible tensor operator technique. We elucidate the major electronic factors controlling the magnetic anisotropy in the Co(II) pairs. The degree of the exchange anisotropy is shown to depend on the strength of the cubic crystal field and on the relative efficiency of two kinds of electron transfer pathways (e–e and t2–t2) contributing to the kinetic exchange. An unusual role of spin–orbit interaction is revealed. This interaction tends to reduce the anisotropy caused by the orbitally dependent exchange. Special attention is paid on the topical case when spin–orbit coupling exceeds the exchange interaction. In this case the effective Hamiltonian in its general form is projected onto the subspace of low-lying Kramers doublets and in such a way the pseudo-spin-12 Hamiltonian is derived. Unlike the commonly accepted phenomenological approaches based merely on the symmetry arguments the proposed procedure is grounded on the microscopic consideration and hence allows us to establish the interrelation between the idem parameters of the system and the effective parameters of the pseudo-spin-12 Hamiltonian. Finally, we discuss the applicability of the conventional Lines’ model.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {We present novel methods implemented within the non-equilibrium Green function code (NEGF) transiesta based on density functional theory (DFT). Our flexible, next-generation DFT–NEGF code handles devices with one or multiple electrodes (Ne≥1) with individual chemical potentials and electronic temperatures. We describe its novel methods for electrostatic gating, contour optimizations, and assertion of charge conservation, as well as the newly implemented algorithms for optimized and scalable matrix inversion, performance-critical pivoting, and hybrid parallelization. Additionally, a generic NEGF “post-processing” code (tbtrans/phtrans) for electron and phonon transport is presented with several novelties such as Hamiltonian interpolations, Ne≥1 electrode capability, bond-currents, generalized interface for user-defined tight-binding transport, transmission projection using eigenstates of a projected Hamiltonian, and fast inversion algorithms for large-scale simulations easily exceeding 106 atoms on workstation computers. The new features of both codes are demonstrated and bench-marked for relevant test systems.},

In chemically-passivated p-type GaAs films at 300 K, we show experimentally and theoretically that the photovoltage lateral dependence is able to block the photoelectron diffusion, thus reducing the effective charge diffusion constant by a factor of ≈5 with respect to surface-free conditions and producing a self-trapping of photoelectrons. This effect is not present for surface-free and for oxidized samples, for which the photovoltage magnitude is strongly reduced. The photovoltage lateral variation also induces a coupling between charge and spin diffusion. Because of this coupling, the effective spin diffusion constant is significantly larger than the effective charge one.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In this approach, the local occupied orbitals of the total Hartree-Fock (HF) wavefunction are used to partition the fully interacting system into three chemically identifiable units: the noncovalent fragments A and B and a covalent linker C. Once these units are identified, the noninteracting HF wavefunctions of the fragments A and B are separately optimized while embedded in the HF wavefunction of C, providing the dressed zeroth order wavefunctions for A and B in the presence of C. Standard two-body SAPT (particularly SAPT0) is then applied between the relaxed wavefunctions for A and B. This intramolecular SAPT procedure is found to be remarkably straightforward and efficient, as evidenced by example applications ranging from diols to hexaphenyl-ethane derivatives.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) offer a unique alternative to traditional display technologies. Tailored device architecture can offer properties such as flexibility and transparency, presenting unparalleled application possibilities. Commercial advancement of OLEDs is highly anticipated, and continued research is vital for improving device efficiency and lifetime. The performance of an OLED relies on an intricate balance between stability, efficiency, operational driving voltage, and color coordinates, with the aim of optimizing these parameters by employing an appropriate material design. Multiscale simulation techniques can aid with the rational design of these materials, in order to overcome existing shortcomings. For example, extensive research has focused on the emissive layer and the obstacles surrounding blue OLEDs, in particular, the trade-off between stability and efficiency, while preserving blue emission. More generally, due to the vast number of contending organic materials and with experimental pre-screening being notoriously time-consuming, a complementary in silico approach can be considerably beneficial. The ultimate goal of simulations is the prediction of device properties from chemical composition, prior to synthesis. However, various challenges must be overcome to bring this to a realization, some of which are discussed in this Perspective. Computer aided design is becoming an essential component for future OLED developments, and with the field shifting toward machine learning based approaches, in silico pre-screening is the future of material design.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Spin‐crossover (SCO) complexes are an ongoing challenge to quantum chemistry due to the delicate balance of their electronic and entropic contributions to the adiabatic enthalpy difference between the high‐ and low‐spin states. This challenge has fuelled an improvement in the existing quantum chemical methods and the development of new ones and will continue to do so. The progress in electronic structure calculations performed on SCO complexes in recent years has made quantum chemical methods valuable tools that may aid the design of new SCO compounds with desirable features. Post‐Hartree–Fock ab initio methods can be used to calculate the adiabatic energy difference between high‐ and low‐spin states with satisfactory accuracy but are currently limited to model systems or smaller molecular SCO complexes. The results obtained by these methods serve as references for other electronic structure calculations that may also be applied to larger systems. The methods of choice for the calculation of geometries and molecular vibrations of isolated SCO complexes and of crystalline compounds are based on density functional theory (DFT). Recent hybrid functionals can be used to calculate the adiabatic energy difference to an accuracy that is in some cases close to that of ab initio calculations, although no unique functional has been identified up to now that is superior to other functionals in all cases. DFT methods can now also be applied to crystalline systems and allow intermolecular effects to be investigated that are important for understanding the cooperativity of spin transitions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Local Mn moments for the free and ligandated molecular magnets are presented and compared to experiment. We identify the occupied and unoccupied electronic states that are most responsible for the formation of the large anisotropy barrier and use a recently developed full-space and full-potential method for calculating the spin–orbit coupling interaction and anisotropy energies.

This is often obtained by spin exchange-bias, where an element with long-range magnetic order creates magnetized states and displaces the hysteresis loop. Here we demonstrate that exchange-split spin states are observable and usable in the smallest conceivable unit: a single magnetic molecule. We use a redox-active porphyrin as a transport channel, coordinating a dysprosium-based single-molecule-magnet inside a graphene nano-gap. Single-molecule transport in magnetic field reveals the existence of exchange-split channels with different spin-polarizations that depend strongly on the field orientation, and comparison with the diamagnetic isostructural compound and milikelvin torque magnetometry unravels the role of the single-molecule anisotropy and the molecular orientation.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}We propose a method for the evaluation of magnetic exchange couplings based on noncollinear spin density functional calculations. The method employs the second derivative of the total Kohn–Sham energy of a single reference state, in contrast to approximations based on Kohn–Sham total energy differences. The advantage of our approach is twofold: It provides a physically motivated picture of the transition from a low-spin to a high-spin state, and it utilizes a perturbation scheme for the evaluation of magnetic exchange couplings. The latter simplifies the way these parameters are predicted using first principles: It avoids the nontrivial search for different spin states that needs to be carried out in energy difference methods, and it opens the possibility of “black-boxifying” the extraction of exchange couplings from density functional theory calculations. We present proof of concept calculations of magnetic exchange couplings in the H–He–H model system and in an oxovanadium bimetallic complex where the results can be intuitively rationalized.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In this work, we investigated the emission properties of binary blends of conjugated polymers and perovskite NCs. We demonstrate that the emission color of the blends is determined by the superposition of the component photoluminescence spectra, allowing color tuning by acting on the blend relative composition. The use of two different polymers, two different perovskite NCs, and different blend compositions is exploited to tune the blend color in the blue-green, yellow-red, and blue-red ranges, including white light generation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This limitation can be overcome by using a different class of functionals, called van der Waals density functional (vdW-DF), originally developed by Dion et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 246401 (2004)]. In this work, we performed a systematic study of structural properties of polymeric crystals using the original vdW-DF functional by Dion et al. and its variants and refinements. Our study shows that this class of functional outperforms the conventional LDA or PBE functionals and gives results with similar accuracy to that of empirical dispersion-corrected schemes such as DFT-D. This study suggests the use of vdW-DF2 functional — a revised version of vdW-DF functional — to obtain a high-fidelity prediction of structural and other properties of polymeric materials.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}We present a method for calculating magnetic coupling parameters from a single spin-configuration via analytic derivatives of the electronic energy with respect to the local spin direction. This method does not introduce new approximations beyond those found in the Heisenberg-Dirac Hamiltonian and a standard Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory calculation, and in the limit of an ideal Heisenberg system it reproduces the coupling as determined from spin-projected energy-differences. Our method employs a generalized perturbative approach to constrained density functional theory, where exact expressions for the energy to second order in the constraints are obtained by analytic derivatives from coupled-perturbed theory. When the relative angle between magnetization vectors of metal atoms enters as a constraint, this allows us to calculate all the magnetic exchange couplings of a system from derivatives with respect to local spin directions from the high-spin configuration. Because of the favorable computational scaling of our method with respect to the number of spin-centers, as compared to the broken-symmetry energy-differences approach, this opens the possibility for the blackbox exploration of magnetic properties in large polynuclear transition-metal complexes. In this work we outline the motivation, theory, and implementation of this method, and present results for several model systems and transition-metal complexes with a variety of density functional approximations and Hartree-Fock.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Fourth-rung hybrid functionals admixing nonlocal exchange improve the results.

The results are compared to (previous and presently obtained) results from density functional theory (DFT) calculations with four functionals, which were already shown previously by Casida and co-workers [Fouqueau et al., J. Chem. Phys. 120, 9473 (2004); Ganzenmüller et al., ibid. 122, 234321 (2005); Fouqueau et al., ibid. 122, 044110 (2005); Lawson Daku et al., ChemPhysChem 6, 1393 (2005)] to perform well for the spin-pairing problem in these and other Fe(II) complexes, i.e., OLYP, PBE0, B3LYP, and B3LYP*. Very extended basis sets were used both for the DFT and CASPT2 calculations and were shown to be necessary to obtain quantitative results with both types of method. This work presents a sequel to a previous DFT/CASPT2 study of the same property in the complexes [Fe(H2O)6]2+, [Fe(NH3)6]2+, and [Fe(bpy)3]2+ [Pierloot et al., J. Chem. Phys. 125, 124303 (2006)]. The latter work was extended with new results obtained with larger basis sets and including the OLYP functional. For all considered complexes, the CASPT2 method predicts the correct ground state spin multiplicity. Since experimental data for the actual quintet-singlet (free) energy differences are not available, the performance of the different DFT functionals was judged based on the comparison between the DFT and CASPT2 results. From this, it was concluded that the generalized gradient OLYP functional performs remarkably well for the present series of ferrous compounds, whereas the success of the three hybrid functionals varies from case to case.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

After considering the organizing principles responsible for the emergence of plasmons, quasiparticles, and conventional superconductivity in SCES, I consider their application to three of SCES’s sister systems, the helium liquids, nuclei, and the nuclear matter found in neutron stars. I note some recent applications of the random phase approximation and examine briefly the role that paradigm change is playing in two central problems in our field: understanding the emergence and subsequent behavior of heavy electrons in Kondo lattice materials; and finding the mechanism for the unconventional superconductivity found in heavy electron, organic, cuprate, and iron-based materials.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The application of predictive and reliable modeling techniques for the simulation of charge transport in functional materials is an essential step for the development of advanced platforms for electronics, optoelectronics, and photovoltaics. In this context, kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) methods have emerged as a valuable tool, especially for the simulation of systems where charge transport can be described by the hopping of charge carriers across localized quantum states, as, for example, in organic semiconductor materials. The accuracy, computational efficiency, and reliability of KMC simulations of charge transport, however, crucially depend on the methods and approximations used to evaluate electrostatic interactions arising from the distribution of charges in the system. The long-range nature of Coulomb interactions and the need to simulate large model systems to capture the details of charge transport phenomena in complex devices lead, typically, to a computational bottleneck, which hampers the application of KMC methods. Here, we propose and assess computational schemes for the evaluation of electrostatic interactions in KMC simulations of charge transport based on the locality of the charge redistribution in the hopping regime. The methods outlined in this work provide an overall accuracy that outperforms typical approaches for the evaluation of electrostatic interactions in KMC simulations at a fraction of the computational cost. In addition, the computational schemes proposed allow a spatial decomposition of the evaluation of Coulomb interactions, leading to an essentially linear scaling of the computational load with the size of the system.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Descriptions based only on a simple K-point filtering picture (i.e. MR increase with the number of layers) are not sufficient to predict the behavior of our devices.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The renormalization of electronic eigenenergies due to electron-phonon coupling (temperature dependence and zero-point motion effect) is sizable in many materials with light atoms. This effect, often neglected in ab initio calculations, can be computed using the perturbation-based Allen-Heine-Cardona theory in the adiabatic or non-adiabatic harmonic approximation. After a short description of the recent progresses in this field and a brief overview of the theory, we focus on the issue of phonon wavevector sampling convergence, until now poorly understood. Indeed, the renormalization is obtained numerically through a slowly converging q-point integration. For non-zero Born effective charges, we show that a divergence appears in the electron-phonon matrix elements at q → Γ, leading to a divergence of the adiabatic renormalization at band extrema. This problem is exacerbated by the slow convergence of Born effective charges with electronic wavevector sampling, which leaves residual Born effective charges in ab initio calculations on materials that are physically devoid of such charges. Here, we propose a solution that improves this convergence. However, for materials where Born effective charges are physically non-zero, the divergence of the renormalization indicates a breakdown of the adiabatic harmonic approximation, which we assess here by switching to the non-adiabatic harmonic approximation. Also, we study the convergence behavior of the renormalization and develop reliable extrapolation schemes to obtain the converged results. Finally, the adiabatic and non-adiabatic theories, with corrections for the slow Born effective charge convergence problem (and the associated divergence) are applied to the study of five semiconductors and insulators: α-AlN, β-AlN, BN, diamond, and silicon. For these five materials, we present the zero-point renormalization, temperature dependence, phonon-induced lifetime broadening, and the renormalized electronic band structure.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We overview traditional model approaches for the phenomenological description of such systems and outline some ways used to parameterize the corresponding models from experiment and from first‐principle calculations. The latter can be either multi‐determinantal quantum chemical schemes or those based on the density functional theory. In particular we discuss Heisenberg exchange parameters and magnetic anisotropy constants. As a practical example, an introduction into problems and properties of some single‐molecule magnets which gained much attention within last years, namely Mn $_{\textrm{12}}$ ‐acetate, “Fe $_{\textrm{8}}$ ” and “V $_{\textrm{15}}$ ” systems, is given. This introduction into systems is followed by a critical comparison of calculation schemes based on the density functional theory that are particularly well suited for the study of molecular magnets. For the above systems we select some benchmark results, obtained by different methods. Finally, we outline our recent progress in the study of other single‐molecule magnets, including six‐membered “ferric wheels”, “ferric stars” and “Ni $_{\textrm{4}}$ ” molecules, which we studied with the use of first‐principles methods Siesta and NRLMOL.

The corresponding conduction-band offset (CBO) values are 3.63 eV and 1.27 eV. Similarly, the calculated VBO and CBO values for an ultrathin layer of MoS2/SiO2 are estimated to be 4.25 and 2.91 eV, respectively. However, a very thick layer of MoS2 on Al2O3 and ZrO2 layers increases the CBO and VBO values by 0.31 eV and 0.2 eV, respectively, due to the shifting of the Mo 4dz2 band toward the Fermi level. The atomic force microscopy images show that the films are atomically smooth and favor the formation of a high-quality interface between the substrate and the film. The investigated luminescence spectra reveal that the MoS2 films show very strong interactions with different high-k surfaces, whereas the Raman spectrum is only weakly influenced by the different dielectric substrates.

Recently, Pizzi et al. introduced the AiiDA framework that provides a way to automate calculations while allowing to store the full provenance of complex workflows in a database. We present the development of the AiiDA-KKR plugin that allows to perform a large number of ab initio impurity embedding calculations based on the relativistic full-potential Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker Green function method. The capabilities of the AiiDA-KKR plugin are demonstrated with the calculation of several thousand impurities embedded into the prototypical topological insulator Sb $_{\textrm{2}}$ Te $_{\textrm{3}}$ . The results are collected in the JuDiT database which we use to investigate chemical trends as well as Fermi level and layer dependence of physical properties of impurities. This includes the study of spin moments, the impurity’s tendency to form in-gap states or its effect on the charge doping of the host-crystal. These properties depend on the detailed electronic structure of the impurity embedded into the host crystal which highlights the need for ab initio calculations in order to get accurate predictions. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Here, we show that for the applied pressure variation from 1 bar to 4.1 kbar, the isothermal entropy change (ΔST) in a one-dimensional spin crossover system [Fe(hyptrz)3](4-chlorophenylsulfonate)2H2O achieves a maximum value of 55.8 J mol−1 K−1 at 191 K, leading to a huge refrigerant capacity of 2160 J mol−1.

Herein, the incremental full configuration interaction method is applied to the entire space of valence orbitals of a Fe(II)–porphyrin model using a modest basis set. A novel visualization framework is proposed to analyze individual many-body contributions to the correlation energy, providing detailed maps of this complex’s highly correlated electronic structure. This technique is used to parse the numerous interactions of two low-lying triplet states (3A2g and 3Eg) and to show that strong metal d–d and macrocycle π–π orbital interactions preferentially stabilize the 3A2g state. d–π interactions, on the other hand, preferentially stabilize the 3Eg state and primarily appear when correlating six electrons at a time. Ultimately, the Fe(II)–porphyrin model’s full set of 88 valence electrons are correlated in 275 orbitals, showing the interactions up to the 4-body level, which covers the great majority of correlations in this system.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The theory of excited electronic states is central to a quantitative understanding of the interaction between light and matter and hence to calculations of various x-ray and optical spectra. Although ground state properties are well described by density functional theory (DFT), that theory is inappropriate for excited states, for which a fully quantitative theory has yet to be developed. No one has contributed more to than Lars Hedin to the quest for such a theory. Here we briefly review a number of his key contributions. One of the most influential is the ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂGWÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ approximation for the self-energy of an excited electron. Another is the ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂblue-electronÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ approximation for photon and electron spectroscopies. A third, which is relevant to the topics of this conference, is a many-body theory of x-ray spectra based on the ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂquasi-bosonÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ approximation. This approach is a generalization of the GW approximation which takes into account both extrinsic and intrinsic losses as well as the interference between them, and simplifies the treatment of losses and the core-hole interaction. What makes Hedin's theories stand out is their mathematical elegance and physical robustness, based on ideas conceived before their full implementation was practical. With today's advances in computational power, however, the impact of Lars' work is becoming ever more widely appreciated.},

The spin-orbit interaction is usually neglected in nitrides, which leads to three doubly degenerate bands: the heavy-hole, light-hole, and crystal-field split-off bands. Including the spin-orbit interaction, this degeneracy is removed to give six single bands. We obtained the Luttinger-like parameters in bulk wurtzite GaN by fitting data obtained from an empirical pseudopotential calculation obtaining a value for the parameter A7 of 93.7 meV/Å. We also used these results to calculate the valence-band structures of a GaN/AlGaN quantum well. Our result shows the spin-orbit interaction is important in GaN and associated quantum well structures.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The g-GaN/Mg(OH)2 heterostructure is discovered to be formed by van der Waals (vdW) forces and possesses a type-II band structure which can promote the separation of photogenerated electron–holes constantly. At the same time, the calculated band edge positions of the heterostructure are decent to induce the oxidation and reduction reactions for water splitting at pH 0. Gibb's free energy change in the redox reaction for the g-GaN/Mg(OH)2 vdW heterostructure is further investigated that the heterostructure can act as a suitable catalyst in hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction for water splitting. The charge-density difference and the potential drop are calculated across the interface of the g-GaN/Mg(OH)2 vdW heterostructure, and the potential drop can induce a large built-in electric field, which is also a boost to prevent the recombination of the photogenerated charges. Finally, the applied external biaxial strain is studied that it can improve the optical absorption performance of the g-GaN/Mg(OH)2 vdW heterostructure. This study provides a possibility of method to design the 2D vdW heterostructure as a photocatalyst to decompose water.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} Using ultrafast optical absorption spectroscopy, the room‐temperature spin‐state switching dynamics induced by a femtosecond laser pulse in high‐quality thin films of the molecular spin‐crossover (SCO) complex [Fe(HB(tz) $_{\textrm{3}}$ ) $_{\textrm{2}}$ ] (tz = 1,2,4‐triazol‐1‐yl) are studied. These measurements reveal that the early, sub‐picosecond, low‐spin to high‐spin photoswitching event, with linear response to the laser pulse energy, can be followed under certain conditions by a second switching process occurring on a timescale of tens of nanoseconds, enabling nonlinear amplification. This out‐of‐equilibrium dynamics is discussed in light of the characteristic timescales associated with the different switching mechanisms, i.e., the electronic and structural rearrangements of photoexcited molecules, the propagation of strain waves at the material scale, and the thermal activation above the molecular energy barrier. Importantly, the additional, nonlinear switching step appears to be completely suppressed in the thinnest (50 nm) film due to the efficient heat transfer to the substrate, allowing the system to retrieve the thermal equilibrium state on the 100 ns timescale. These results provide a first milestone toward the assessment of the physical parameters that drive the photoresponse of SCO thin films, opening up appealing perspectives for their use as high‐frequency all‐optical switches working at room temperature. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Here we evaluate the performance of MoS $_{\textrm{2}}$ -based tunnel junctions using Fe $_{\textrm{3}}$ Si Heusler alloy electrodes. Density functional theory and the non-equilibrium Green’s function method are used to investigate the spin injection efficiency (SIE) and the magnetoresistance (MR) ratio as a function of the MoS $_{\textrm{2}}$ thickness. We find a maximum MR of {\textasciitilde}300\% with a SIE of about 80\% for spacers comprising between 3 and 5 MoS $_{\textrm{2}}$ monolayers.

	abstract = {Supramolecular metal ion assemblies are deposited from their solutions onto highly orientated pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) substrates to be imaged by scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM). Since the structural and electronic information of STM measurements are strongly entangled, the spectroscopic interpretation and analysis of the images of such molecular assemblies has proven to be challenging. This tutorial review focuses on a general room temperature scanning tunnelling spectroscopy (STS) protocol, current induced tunnelling spectroscopy (CITS), applied to free-standing 1D and 2D arrangements of supramolecular metal ion assemblies rendering local tunnelling probabilities with submolecular resolution. The size of the investigated molecular assemblies was confirmed by comparison with X-ray crystallographic data, while the consistency of the spectroscopic investigations and of the determined positions of the metal ions within the assemblies was checked by DFT calculations. Due to the genuine level structure of coordinated metal centers, it was possible to map exclusively the position of the coordination bonds in supramolecular transition metal assemblies with submolecular spatial resolution using the CITS technique. CITS might thus constitute an important tool to achieve directed bottom-up construction and controlled manipulation of fully electronically functional, two-dimensional molecular designs.},

We note that the true uncoupled low-spin state of a given molecule should be identified with the ground state of the system subject to a constraint on the spin density of the atoms. Using an efficient optimization strategy for constrained DFT we obtain these states directly, leading to a simple, physically motivated formula for J. Our method only depends on state energies and their associated electron densities and assigns no unphysical meaning to the Kohn-Sham determinant or individual orbitals. We study several bimetallic transition-metal complexes and find that the constrained DFT approach is competitive with, if not better than, the best broken symmetry DFT results. The success of constrained DFT in these cases appears to result from a balanced elimination of self-interaction error and static correlation from the simulation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Spin crossover systems are potentially more useful than other magnetic molecules because their switching behaviour can occur closer to room temperature, and they are thus candidates for use in spintronic devices.

These Cu $^{\textrm{II}}$ ‐nitroxide based molecular magnets display thermally and optically induced switchable behavior and light‐induced excited spin state trapping phenomena. The calculations confirm the presence of temperature‐dependent exchange interaction within the spin triads formed by the nitroxide‐copper(II)‐nitroxide units, in line with the changes observed in the effective magnetic moment. Moreover, they quantify the interchain interaction mediated by the terminal nitroxide group of two spin triads in neighboring polymer chains. This interaction competes with the exchange interaction within the spin triads at high temperature, and introduces 1D exchange channels that do not coincide with the polymeric chains. The density of states reveal that the low‐lying conduction states potentially involved in the UV/Vis transitions are located on the nitroxide radicals, the hfac groups and the Cu atoms. Then, the density of states is almost independent of the solvent and the R group. This suggests the possibility of light‐induced spin switching for other members of this family. The 500 nm band of the low‐temperature phase can be ascribed to a ligand‐to‐metal charge transfer transition between the nitroxide and Cu bands. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}We study ground-state properties of a two-site, two-electron Holstein model describing two molecules coupled indirectly via electron-phonon interaction by using both exact diagonalization and self-consistent diagrammatic many-body perturbation theory. The Hartree and self-consistent Born approximations used in the present work are studied at different levels of self-consistency. The governing equations are shown to exhibit multiple solutions when the electron-phonon interaction is sufficiently strong, whereas at smaller interactions, only a single solution is found. The additional solutions at larger electron-phonon couplings correspond to symmetry-broken states with inhomogeneous electron densities. A comparison to exact results indicates that this symmetry breaking is strongly correlated with the formation of a bipolaron state in which the two electrons prefer to reside on the same molecule. The results further show that the Hartree and partially self-consistent Born solutions obtained by enforcing symmetry do not compare well with exact energetics, while the fully self-consistent Born approximation improves the qualitative and quantitative agreement with exact results in the same symmetric case. This together with a presented natural occupation number analysis supports the conclusion that the fully self-consistent approximation describes partially the bipolaron crossover. These results contribute to better understanding how these approximations cope with the strong localizing effect of the electron-phonon interaction.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In this regard, graphene supports with topological disorder are considered as promising substrate materials for the TM clusters as defects can act as anchoring centers. Based on density functional theory for Ni clusters deposited on graphene nanoflakes, we show that magnetic anisotropy of Ni clusters can be tuned by specific topological defects in the graphene substrate. Systematic studies performed on pentagonal and heptagonal defects in graphene flakes show that Ni13 deposited on heptagonal defected graphene flake is a promising candidate with a large magnetic anisotropy energy of about ∼16 meV.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}MoS2 and other transition metal dichalcogenides are considered as potential materials in many applications including future electronics. A prerequisite for these applications is to understand the nature of the MoS2 contact with different metals. We use semi-local density functional theory in conjunction with dispersion corrections to study the heterostructures composed of Pd and Pt monolayers with (111) orientation grown pseudomorphically on MoS2(001). The interface properties are mapped as a function of the number of deposited overlayers, as well as a function of tensile and compressive strains. Although we show that the dependence of the contacts on strain can be fully explained using the d-band model, we find that their evolution with the number of deposited metal layers is markedly different between Pd and Pt, and at variance with the d-band model. Specifically, the Pt/MoS2 heterostructures show an anomalous large stability with the deposition of two metal monolayers for all investigated strains, while Pd/MoS2 exhibits a similar behavior only for compressive strains. It is shown that the results can be rationalized by accounting for second-nearest-neighbor effect that couples MoS2 with the subsurface metal layers. The underpinnings of this behavior are attributed to the larger polarizability and cohesive energy of Pt compared to Pd, that leads to a larger charge-response in the subsurface layers.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Reiher, O. Salomon, and B. A. Hess, Theor. Chem. Acc., 107, 48 (2001)] that pure and hybrid density functionals yield energy splittings between high-spin and low-spin states of Fe–sulfur complexes that differ by more than 100 kJ/mol and thus fail to reliably predict the correct multiplicity of the ground state. This deviation can lead to meaningless reaction energetics for metal-catalyzed reactions. The finding that the energy splitting depends linearly on the exact exchange admixture parameter led to a new parametrization of the B3LYP functional which was dubbed B3LYP⋆. In the present paper we investigate the generality and transferability of this functional. We study the extent to which the exact exchange admixture affects the thermochemistry validated with respect to the reference data set of molecules from the G2 test set. Metallocenes and bis(benzene) metal complexes of the first transition metal period are chosen to test the transferability of the findings for Fe–sulfur complexes. Moreover, the slope of the linear dependence of the energy splitting of high-spin and low-spin states on the amount of admixture of exact exchange is studied in detail.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Semiconductor–metal heterojunction nanostructures possess an ability to store electrons upon photoexcitation through Fermi level equilibration. The unique role of capping ligands in modulating the equilibration of Fermi level in CdSe–Au heteronanostructures is explored by taking alkyl thiols and alkyl amines as examples. Alkyl thiol having its highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) above the valence band of the heterojunction nanostructure inhibits the exciton recombination by scavenging the photogenerated hole. This leads to the elevation in the Fermi level of Au and equilibration with the conduction band of CdSe. The Fermi level equilibrated electrons are further transferred to an acceptor molecule such as methyl viologen, demonstrating the potential of heterojunction nanostructures capped with hole accepting ligands for charge transport application in photovoltaics. In contrast, alkyl amine being a non-hole acceptor ligand with its HOMO placed below its valence band promotes rapid Au mediated exciton recombination, limiting its usefulness in charge transport application. Thus, the energetics of ligands on heterojunction nanostructures plays a decisive role in Fermi level equilibration.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Ir(ppy)3:CBP blends have been widely studied as the emissive layer in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), yet crucial questions about charge transport within the layer remain unaddressed. Recent molecular dynamics simulations show that the Ir(ppy)3 molecules are not isolated from each other, but at concentrations of as low as 5 wt. \% can be part of connected pathways. Such connectivity raises the question of how the iridium(iii) complexes contribute to long-range charge transport in the blend. We implement a kinetic Monte Carlo transport model to probe the guest concentration dependence of charge mobility and show that distinct minima appear at approximately 10 wt. \% Ir(ppy)3 due to an increased number of trap states that can include interconnected complexes within the blend film. The depth of the minima is shown to be dependent on the electric field and to vary between electrons and holes due to their different trapping depths arising from the different ionization potentials and electron affinities of the guest and host molecules. Typical guest-host OLEDs use a guest concentration below 10 wt. \% to avoid triplet-triplet annihilation, so these results suggest that optimal device performance is achieved when there is significant charge trapping on the iridium(iii) complex guest molecules and minimum interactions of the emissive chromophores that can lead to triplet-triplet annihilation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

While significant exploratory research in 2D materials has been achieved, the understanding of 2D electronic transport and carrier dynamics remains in a nascent stage. Furthermore, because prior review articles have provided general overviews of 2D materials or specifically focused on charge transport in graphene, here we instead highlight charge transport mechanisms in post-graphene 2D materials, with particular emphasis on transition metal dichalcogenides and black phosphorus. For these systems, we delineate the intricacies of electronic transport, including band structure control with thickness and external fields, valley polarization, scattering mechanisms, electrical contacts, and doping. In addition, electronic interactions between 2D materials are considered in the form of van der Waals heterojunctions and composite films. This review concludes with a perspective on the most promising future directions in this fast-evolving field.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In contrast to previous approximation-free MP2 codes, our implementation possesses a quartic scaling, O(N4), with respect to the system size N and offers an almost ideal parallelization efficiency. The general issue that the correlation energy converges slowly with the number of basis functions is eased by an internal basis set extrapolation. The key concept to reduce the scaling is to eliminate all summations over virtual orbitals which can be elegantly achieved in the Laplace transformed MP2 formulation using plane wave basis sets and fast Fourier transforms. Analogously, this approach could allow us to calculate second order screened exchange as well as particle-hole ladder diagrams with a similar low complexity. Hence, the presented method can be considered as a step towards systematically improved correlation energies.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The lifetimes are in the order of femtoseconds due to an effective electron-electron relaxation process caused by the strong hybridization of the impurity states and the substrate. The different lifetimes are explained by the quantum mechanical nature of Fe and Co on Pt(111).

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Markov state models have become popular in the computational biochemistry and biophysics communities as a technique for identifying stationary and kinetic information of protein dynamics from molecular dynamics simulation data. In this paper, we extend the applicability of automated Markov state modeling to simulation data of molecular self-assembly and aggregation by constructing collective coordinates from molecular descriptors that are invariant to permutations of molecular indexing. Understanding molecular self-assembly is of critical importance if we want to deepen our understanding of neurodegenerative diseases where the aggregation of misfolded or disordered proteins is thought to be the main culprit. As a proof of principle, we demonstrate our Markov state model technique on simulations of the KFFE peptide, a subsequence of Alzheimer’s amyloid-β peptide and one of the smallest peptides known to aggregate into amyloid fibrils in vitro. We investigate the different stages of aggregation up to tetramerization and show that the Markov state models clearly map out the different aggregation pathways. Of note is that disordered and β-sheet oligomers do not interconvert, leading to separate pathways for their formation. This suggests that amyloid aggregation of KFFE occurs via ordered aggregates from the very beginning. The code developed here is freely available as a Jupyter notebook called TICAgg, which can be used for the automated analysis of any self-assembling molecular system, protein, or otherwise.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}A finite Schottky barrier and large contact resistance between monolayer MoS2 and electrodes are the major bottlenecks in developing high-performance field-effect transistors (FETs) that hinder the study of intrinsic quantum behaviors such as valley-spin transport at low temperature. A gate-tunable graphene electrode platform has been developed to improve the performance of MoS2 FETs. However, intrinsic misalignment between the work function of pristine graphene and the conduction band of MoS2 results in a large threshold voltage for the FETs, because of which Ohmic contact behaviors are observed only at very high gate voltages and carrier concentrations (∼1013 cm−2). Here, we present high-performance monolayer MoS2 FETs with Ohmic contact at a modest gate voltage by using a chemical-vapor-deposited (CVD) nitrogen-doped graphene with a high intrinsic electron carrier density. The CVD nitrogen-doped graphene and monolayer MoS2 hybrid FETs platform exhibited a large negative shifted threshold voltage of −54.2 V and barrier-free Ohmic contact under zero gate voltage. Transparent contact by nitrogen-doped graphene led to a 214\% enhancement in the on-current and a fourfold improvement in the field-effect carrier mobility of monolayer MoS2 FETs compared with those of a pristine graphene electrode platform. The transport measurements, as well as Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses before and after thermal annealing, reveal that the atomic C-N bonding in the CVD nitrogen-doped graphene is responsible for the dominant effects of electron doping. Large-scale nitrogen-doped graphene electrodes provide a promising device platform for the development of high-performance devices and the study of unique quantum behaviors.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

These range from first-row dimers at equilibrium and stretched geometries to highly multireference systems such as the chromium dimer and lattice models such as periodic two-dimensional 1-band and 3-band Hubbard models. The MPS-LCC theory shows a speed up of several orders of magnitude over the usual Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm while delivering energies in excellent agreement with converged DMRG calculations. Also, in all the benchmark calculations presented here, MPS-LCC outperformed the commonly used multi-reference quantum chemistry methods in some cases giving energies in excess of an order of magnitude more accurate. As a size-extensive method that can treat large active spaces, MPS-LCC opens up the use of multireference quantum chemical techniques in strongly correlated ab initio Hamiltonians, including two- and three-dimensional solids.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In that report, the experimentally obtained value for the dielectric constant was employed. Herein, we discuss a self-consistent technique, in which the value of the dielectric constant can be automatically determined. This technique enables the energy band structure to be determined without using the experimental value. The band energy structure of diamond is calculated, a self-consistent procedure is determined to give closer bandgaps compared with the local density approximation and the generalized gradient approximation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Many recent experimental and theoretical studies have paid attention to the conductivity of single molecule transport junctions, both because it is fundamentally important and because of its significance in the development of molecular-based electronics. In this paper, we discuss a nonequilibrium Green’s function (NEGF)-based Hartree-Fock (HF) approach; the NEGF method can appropriately accommodate charge distributions in molecules connected to electrodes. In addition, we show that a NEGF-based density matrix can reduce to an ordinary HF density matrix for an isolated molecule if the molecule does not interact with electrodes. This feature of the NEGF-based density matrix also means that NEGF-based Mulliken charges can be reduced to ordinary Mulliken charges in those cases. Therefore, the NEGF-based HF approach can directly compare molecules that are connected to electrodes with isolated ones, and is useful in investigating complicated features of molecular conduction. We also calculated the transmission probability and conduction for benzenedithiol under finite electrode biases. The coupling between the electrodes and molecule causes electron transfer from the molecule to the electrodes, and the applied bias modifies this electron transfer. In addition, we found that the molecule responds capacitively to the applied bias, by shifting the molecular orbital energies.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Monolayer GaN is predicted to be an indirect semiconductor with wide gap of 4.44 eV, whose bandgap can be effectively modulated by biaxial strain, ranging from 5.49 eV (δ = −6.5\%) to 2.27 eV (δ = +8\%). In particular, the compressive strain arouses the structural instability of GaN monolayer. Hydrogenation or fluorination not only eliminates its instability, but also tunes the bandgap from indirect to direct. More attractively, tensile strain can significantly redshift the optical spectra of GaN monolayer into the visible-light region, broadening light harvesting. Hydrogenation or fluorination shifts optical activity to the ultra-violet region. The possibility of tuning the optoelectronic properties via strain and surface modification opens doors to novel application of the promising material.},

We show that DORI can successfully replace the ratio of the von Weizsäcker and exact positive-definite kinetic energy densities, which is commonly used in mixing functions of local hybrids.

The ultimate test for the functionals developed is the accuracy of energy calculated by employing them. In this paper, we test these exchange-correlation functionals—the GGA hybrid functionals B3LYP and PBE0 and the meta-GGA functional SCAN—from a different perspective. We study how accurately these functionals reproduce the exchange-correlation energy when electron-electron interaction is scaled as αVee with α varying between 0 and 1. Our study reveals interesting comparison between these functionals and the associated difference Tc between the interacting and the non-interacting kinetic energy for the same density.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In addition to considering the volume difference of the two states at zero pressure, we find it important to include effects both of the difference in compressibility of the two states, and the change in compressibility of a given state with pressure. The theory casts the problem in terms of the changes in Coulomb energy, closed shell repulsions, and both covalent bonding energy and crystal field energy accompanying the change in electronic state. In addition, interactions between converted iron atoms are included by a form of mean field theory and the effects are shown to be significant. Not only is the theory discussed analytically, but also a simple graphical solution is shown which makes it possible to examine readily the qualitative effects of the various parameters. Repulsive interactions spread the conversion over a larger pressure range and may thus explain why so many compounds exhibit rather broad transitions. Attractive and repulsive interactions can lead to cooperative effects. They should account for the reversible yet discontinuous jumps in conversion as a function of temperature previously observed in several phenanthroline and dipyridyl compounds. The possibility of hysteresis is also indicated. Major anomalies in the combined temperature and pressure variation of the conversion are accounted for by including the temperature dependence of the free energy of interaction.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}We describe how multireference dynamic correlation theories can be naturally obtained as single-reference correlation theories in a canonically transformed frame. Such canonically transformed correlation theories are very simple and involve identical expressions to their single-reference counterparts. The corresponding excitations involve quasiparticles rather than the bare particles of the system. High-order density matrices (or their approximations) and the numerical metric instabilities common to multireference correlation theories do not appear. As an example, we formulate the Bogoliubov canonically transformed version of second-order Møller-Plesset perturbation theory and demonstrate its performance in H2, H2O, N2, and BeH2 bond dissociation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {It has been proposed that iron has a significant effect on the relative stability of carbonate phases at high pressures, possibly even stabilizing double-cation carbonates (e.g., dolomite) with respect to single-cation carbonates (e.g., magnesite, aragonite and siderite). X-ray diffraction experiments have shown that dolomite transforms at 35 GPa to a high-pressure polymorph that is stable to decomposition; however, there has been disagreement on the structure of the high-pressure phase (Mao et al. in Geophys Res Lett 38, 2011. doi:10.1029/2011GL049519; Merlini et al. in Proc Natl Acad Sci 109:13509–13514, 2012. doi:10.1073/pnas.1201336109). Ab initio calculations interfaced with an evolutionary structure prediction algorithm demonstrated that a C2/c polymorph of pure CaMg(CO3)2 dolomite is more stable than previously reported structures (Solomatova and Asimow in Am Mineral 102:210–215, 2017, doi:10.2138/am-2017-5830). In this study, we calculate the relative enthalpies up to 80 GPa for a set of carbonate phases including Fe-bearing solutions and endmembers, using the generalized gradient approximation and a Hubbard U parameter calculated through linear response theory to accurately characterize the electronic structure of Fe. When calculated with a constant U of 4ÃÂÃÂ eV, the spin transition pressure of (Mg,Fe)CO3 agrees well with experiments, whereas an internally consistent U overestimates the spin transition pressure by 50ÃÂÃÂ GPa. However, whether we use constant or internally consistent U values, a higher iron concentration increases the stability field of dolomite C2/c with respect to single-cation carbonate assemblages, but iron-free dolomite is not stable with respect to single-cation carbonates at any pressure. Thus, high-pressure polymorphs of Fe-bearing dolomite could in fact represent an important reservoir for carbon storage within oxidized sections of Earth's mantle.},

We compare the standard perturbational approach to calculate the second‐order interaction with a variational strategy based on the effective Hamiltonian theory and show that the former one can only be applied in some special cases and even then gives results that largely overestimate the interaction. The combined effect of geometry distortions and second‐order spin–orbit coupling leads to sizeable interactions for states that are nearly uncoupled in the symmetric (average) structure of the complex. This opens the possibility of a direct deactivation from the singlet and triplet states of the metal‐to‐ligand charge‐transfer manifold to the final high‐spin state as suggested from the interpretation of experimental data but so far not supported by theoretical descriptions of the light‐induced spin crossover.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This enables the use of dispersion-correction schemes in electronic structure calculations without recourse to electron-density partitioning schemes and expands their applicability to semi-empirical methods and tight-binding Hamiltonians. We show that the accuracy of our method is en par with established electron-density partitioning based approaches in describing intermolecular C6 coefficients as well as dispersion energies of weakly bound molecular dimers, organic crystals, and supramolecular complexes. We showcase the utility of our approach by incorporation of the recently developed many-body dispersion method [Tkatchenko et al., Phys. Rev.

A promising framework for such calculations is density functional theory within the non-equilibrium Green’s function formalism (NEGF-DFT). In this paper we present the basic framework and applications of the formalism. The applications include the calculation of the I–V  characteristics of a single molecule connected with gold electrodes and the spin-dependent electron transport through a magneto-tunnel junction consisting of MgO layers sandwiched between Fe electrodes.

 For the formalism to be applied in semiconductor device modeling it needs to be able to handle many thousands of atoms. We discuss new developments and future aspects of the method important for semiconductor device modeling; in particular we show that for important classes of systems the approach scales linearly with the system size.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Tunneling corrections to the classical transition state theory rate are considered for multidimensional anharmonic potentials. A theory is proposed for systematic accounting for the reaction barrier anharmonicity and associated curvature of the reaction path in terms of thermodynamic Green’s functions. A corresponding diagrammatic technique is developed for calculation of the rate constant. The theory allows summation of an infinite number of perturbation terms in a self-consistent manner. It is shown that as a result of self-consistent treatment, a renormalized potential function of the barrier can be introduced in place of the original potential which is the average of the latter over the thermal de Broglie wavelength of the tunneling particle. Even simple approximations for the rate calculated for such averaged potential barrier automatically takes into account a large body of anharmonic and quantum effects. The harmonic approximation of the renormalized potential coincides with the ‘‘best fit’’ quadratic potential surface introduced in the paper of G. Voth, D. Chandler, and W. H. Miller [J. Chem. Phys. 91, 7749 (1989)]. The theory also provides a method for calculation of further anharmonic corrections to this renormalized harmonic approximation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} The stability of magnetic information stored in surface adsorbed single‐molecule magnets is of critical interest for applications in nanoscale data storage or quantum computing. The present study combines X‐ray magnetic circular dichroism, density functional theory and magnetization dynamics calculations to gain deep insight into the substrate dependent relevant magnetization relaxation mechanisms. X‐ray magnetic circular dichroism reveals the opening of a butterfly‐shaped magnetic hysteresis of DyPc $_{\textrm{2}}$ molecules on magnesium oxide and a closed loop on the bare silver substrate, while density functional theory shows that the molecules are only weakly adsorbed in both cases of magnesium oxide and silver. The enhanced magnetic stability of DyPc $_{\textrm{2}}$ on the oxide film, in conjunction with previous experiments on the TbPc $_{\textrm{2}}$ analogue, points to a general validity of the magnesium oxide induced stabilization effect. Magnetization dynamics calculations reveal that the enhanced magnetic stability of DyPc $_{\textrm{2}}$ and TbPc $_{\textrm{2}}$ on the oxide film is due to the suppression of two‐phonon Raman relaxation processes. The results suggest that substrates with low phonon density of states are beneficial for the design of spintronics devices based on single‐molecule magnets. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories based on classical equations of motion can be used to sample the configurational space of complex molecular systems. However, brute-force MD often converges slowly due to the ruggedness of the underlying potential energy surface. Several schemes have been proposed to address this problem by effectively smoothing the potential energy surface. However, in order to recover the proper Boltzmann equilibrium probability distribution, these approaches must then rely on statistical reweighting techniques or generate the simulations within a Hamiltonian tempering replica-exchange scheme. The present work puts forth a novel hybrid sampling propagator combining Metropolis-Hastings Monte Carlo (MC) with proposed moves generated by non-equilibrium MD (neMD). This hybrid neMD-MC propagator comprises three elementary elements: (i) an atomic system is dynamically propagated for some period of time using standard equilibrium MD on the correct potential energy surface; (ii) the system is then propagated for a brief period of time during what is referred to as a “boosting phase,” via a time-dependent Hamiltonian that is evolved toward the perturbed potential energy surface and then back to the correct potential energy surface; (iii) the resulting configuration at the end of the neMD trajectory is then accepted or rejected according to a Metropolis criterion before returning to step 1. A symmetric two-end momentum reversal prescription is used at the end of the neMD trajectories to guarantee that the hybrid neMD-MC sampling propagator obeys microscopic detailed balance and rigorously yields the equilibrium Boltzmann distribution. The hybrid neMD-MC sampling propagator is designed and implemented to enhance the sampling by relying on the accelerated MD and solute tempering schemes. It is also combined with the adaptive biased force sampling algorithm to examine. Illustrative tests with specific biomolecular systems indicate that the method can yield a significant speedup.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Using the tight-binding model for the π system and the Dirac cone approximation, we obtain the analytic expression for the rate of energy transfer from an electronically excited dye to graphene. While in traditional fluorescence resonance energy transfer, the rate has a (distance)−6 dependence, we find that the distance dependence in this case is quite different. Our calculation of rate in the case of the two dyes, pyrene and nile blue, shows that the distance dependence is Yukawa type. We have also studied the effect of doping on energy transfer to graphene. Doping does not modify the rate for electronic excitation energy transfer significantly. However, in the case of vibrational transfer, the rate is found to be increased by an order of magnitude due to doping. This can be attributed to the nonzero density of states at the Fermi level that results from doping.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

A general treatment can be applied to both strongly and weakly correlated systems. When it is applied to an intermediate- and partially filled band within of the host semiconductor gap whose width is less than the semiconductor gap, the original single band can either split as in a Mott transition or not. The former situation is usual and almost always generalized. However the latter also takes place and results from a dilution effect of the self-interaction where a large orbital correlation is reduced if there are other orbital contributions with lower self-interaction in the band. The key is in the choice of the subspace of correlated orbitals. This effect can neither be ignored nor discarded for those systems where there is a substantial mix of states. Examples of these behaviors will be presented and compared to other results. Moreover, the combination of different Hubbard terms acting on different atomic state subspaces can also be used to correct the spurious self-interaction of the bands and the gap underestimation. The relationship between these terms applied to different subspaces of correlated electrons will be presented.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In this paper, we describe how accurate off-lattice ascent paths can be represented with respect to the grid points. This improvement maintains the efficient linear scaling of an earlier version of the algorithm, and eliminates a tendency for the Bader surfaces to be aligned along the grid directions. As the algorithm assigns grid points to charge density maxima, subsequent paths are terminated when they reach previously assigned grid points. It is this grid-based approach which gives the algorithm its efficiency, and allows for the analysis of the large grids generated from plane-wave-based density functional theory calculations.},

We first identify the limits of distance-based heuristics from distributions of metal–ligand bond lengths of over 2000 unique mononuclear Fe(II)/Fe(III) transition-metal complexes. To overcome these limits, we employ artificial neural networks (ANNs) to predict spin-state-dependent metal–ligand bond lengths and classify experimental ground-state spins based on agreement of experimental structures with the ANN predictions.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}A fully self-consistent hybrid dRPA (direct random phase approximation) method, named sc-H[γ]dRPA, is presented with γ = 1/3. The exchange potential of the new method contains a fraction γ of nonlocal Hartree-Fock-like exchange besides the exact local Kohn-Sham (KS) exchange potential. The sc-H[γ]dRPA method, in contrast to a straightforward self-consistent dRPA method within the KS formalism, does not suffer from convergence problems for systems with small eigenvalue gaps. Moreover, the sc-H[γ]dRPA method yields distinctively more accurate reaction, isomerization, and transition state energies than other dRPA approaches, e.g., the frequently used non-self-consistent dRPA method using orbitals and eigenvalues from a KS calculation with the exchange-correlation potential of Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE). The sc-H[γ]dRPA method outperforms second-order Møller-Plesset perturbation theory and coupled cluster singles doubles methods while exhibiting a more favorable scaling of computational costs with system size. A value of γ = 1/3 is shown to be a good choice also for a dRPA@PBE[γ] method, which is a non-self-consistent dRPA method using orbitals and eigenvalues from the hybrid PBE0 method with an admixture of γ = 1/3 of exact exchange instead of the 25\% of the PBE0 functional. The dRPA@PBE[γ] method yields reaction, isomerization, and transition state energies that are as good as the sc-H[γ]dRPA ones but is computationally simpler and more efficient because it does not require the self-consistent construction of the dRPA correlation potential. The direct sc-H[γ]dRPA, on the other hand, in contrast to all standard density-functional methods, yields qualitatively correct correlation potentials.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}We present a general theory to calculate the steady-state heat and electronic currents for nonlinear systems using a perturbative expansion in the system-bath coupling. We explicitly demonstrate that using the truncated Dyson-series leads to divergences in the steady-state limit, thus making it impossible to be used for actual applications. In order to resolve the divergences, we propose a unique choice of initial condition for the reduced density matrix, which removes the divergences at each order. Our approach not only allows us to use the truncated Dyson-series, with a reasonable choice of initial condition, but also gives the expected result that the steady-state solutions should be independent of initial preparations. Using our improved Dyson series we evaluate the heat and electronic currents up to fourth-order in system-bath coupling, a considerable improvement over the standard quantum master equation techniques. We then numerically corroborate our theory for archetypal settings of linear systems using the exact nonequilibrium Green's function approach. Finally, to demonstrate the advantage of our approach, we deal with the nonlinear spin-boson model to evaluate heat current up to fourth-order and find signatures of cotunnelling process.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This Topical Review focuses on the theory and computation of excitons, plasmons and quasiparticle band structures in 2D materials and their heterostructures. The general theory is illustrated by applications to various types of 2D materials including transition metal dichalcogenides, graphene, phosphorene, and hexagonal boron nitride. The weak and highly non-local dielectric function of atomically thin crystals is shown to be responsible for many of the unique properties exhibited by the 2D materials such as the formation of strongly bound, non-Hydrogenic excitons, large band gap renormalization effects, and the different signatures of excitons and plasmons in electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). Among other topics covered are spin-orbit coupling, trions, interlayer excitons, exciton dissociation, and environmental screening. Technical issues associated with the application of the many-body GW method and the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) to 2D materials are also discussed. A combined quantum/classical method is introduced and used throughout to account for dielectric screening and self-energy effects from substrates and van der Waals heterostructures including the difficult case of non-matching lattices.},

In contrast to bulk materials, 2D materials can only exhibit magnetic order in the presence of magnetic anisotropy. In the present work we have used the computational 2D materials database (C2DB) to search for new ferromagnetic 2D materials using the spinwave gap as a simple descriptor that accounts for the role of magnetic anisotropy. In addition to known compounds we find 17 novel insulating materials that exhibit magnetic order at finite temperatures. For these we evaluate the critical temperatures from classical Monte Carlo simulations of a Heisenberg model with exchange and anisotropy parameters obtained from first principles. Starting from 150 stable ferromagnetic 2D materials we find ten candidates that are predicted to have critical temperatures exceeding that of CrI3. We also study the effect of Hubbard corrections in the framework of DFTÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ+ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂU and find that the value of U can have a crucial influence on the prediction of magnetic properties.

We present first principles quantum mechanics calculations of the band edge positions in five transition metal oxides and discuss the feasibility of using these materials in photoelectrochemical cells that produce fuels, including hydrogen, methane, methanol, and formic acid. The band gap center is determined within the framework of DFT+U theory. The valence band maximum (conduction band minimum) is found by subtracting (adding) half of the quasiparticle gap obtained from a non-self-consistent GW calculation.

Particular attention will be paid to the functionals MGGA\_MS2 [J. Sun et al., J. Chem. Phys. 138, 044113 (2013)], mBEEF [J. Wellendorff et al., J. Chem. Phys. 140, 144107 (2014)], and SCAN [J.

It is concluded that for strongly bound solids, functionals of the GGA, i.e., rung 2 of Jacob’s ladder, are as accurate as the more sophisticated functionals of the higher rungs, while it is necessary to use dispersion corrected functionals in order to expect at least meaningful results for weakly bound solids.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) has established itself as a reliable and well-controlled approximation to study correlation effects in bulk solids and also two-dimensional systems. In combination with standard density-functional theory (DFT), it has been successfully applied to study materials in which localized electronic states play an important role. It was recently shown that this approach can also be successfully applied to study correlation effects in nanostructures. Here, we provide some details on our recently proposed DFT+DMFT approach to study the magnetic properties of nanosystems [V. Turkowski, A. Kabir, N. Nayyar, and T. S. Rahman, J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 22, 462202 (2010)] and apply it to examine the magnetic properties of small FePt clusters. We demonstrate that DMFT produces meaningful results even for such small systems. For benchmarking and better comparison with results obtained using DFT+U, we also include the case of small Fe clusters. As in the case of bulk systems, the latter approach tends to overestimate correlation effects in nanostructures. Finally, we discuss possible ways to further improve the nano-DFT+DMFT approximation and to extend its application to molecules and nanoparticles on substrates and to nonequilibrium phenomena.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	doi = {10.1063/1.4921301},
	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}We introduce orbital specific virtuals (OSVs) to represent the truncated pair-specific virtual space in periodic local Møller-Plesset perturbation theory of second order (LMP2). The OSVs are constructed by diagonalization of the LMP2 amplitude matrices which correspond to diagonal Wannier-function (WF) pairs. Only a subset of these OSVs is adopted for the subsequent OSV-LMP2 calculation, namely, those with largest contribution to the diagonal pair correlation energy and with the accumulated value of these contributions reaching a certain accuracy. The virtual space for a general (non diagonal) pair is spanned by the union of the two OSV sets related to the individual WFs of the pair. In the periodic LMP2 method, the diagonal LMP2 amplitude matrices needed for the construction of the OSVs are calculated in the basis of projected atomic orbitals (PAOs), employing very large PAO domains. It turns out that the OSVs are excellent to describe short range correlation, yet less appropriate for long range van der Waals correlation. In order to compensate for this bias towards short range correlation, we augment the virtual space spanned by the OSVs by the most diffuse PAOs of the corresponding minimal PAO domain. The Fock and overlap matrices in OSV basis are constructed in the reciprocal space. The 4-index electron repulsion integrals are calculated by local density fitting and, for distant pairs, via multipole approximation. New procedures for determining the fit-domains and the distant-pair lists, leading to higher efficiency in the 4-index integral evaluation, have been implemented. Generally, and in contrast to our previous PAO based periodic LMP2 method, the OSV-LMP2 method does not require anymore great care in the specification of the individual domains (to get a balanced description when calculating energy differences) and is in that sense a black box procedure. Discontinuities in potential energy surfaces, which may occur for PAO-based calculations if one is not careful, virtually disappear for OSV-LMP2. Moreover, due to much increased compactness of the pair-specific virtual spaces, the OSV-LMP2 calculations are faster and require much less memory than PAO-LMP2 calculations, despite the noticeable overhead of the initial OSV construction procedure.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

As a general trend, the M06 functional is about equally as accurate as B3LYP or PBE0.

We understand the origin of QI in terms of symmetry arguments, which show the robustness and generality of the effect. This also allows us to devise a concrete protocol for the electrostatic control of the spin polarization of the current by breaking the sublattice symmetry of graphene, by deposition on hexagonal boron nitride, paving the way to switchable spin filters. Such a system benefits from all of the extraordinary conduction properties of graphene, and at the same time, it does not require any external magnetic field to select the spin polarization, as magnetism emerg},

	abstract = {The quest for purely organic magnetic materials has been the subject of intensive research activity during the last decade[1]. The goal of this research is the preparation of a material that combines the inherent properties of organic compounds with an usable magnetic property, like for instance ferromagnetism, ferrimagnetism or superparamagnetism. It is expected that such materials will have peculiar and probably unprecedented properties not shown by the traditional inorganic magnetic materials based on metallic or ionic lattices. Some of the foreseeable advantages of the organic and polymeric over the traditional materials have been discussed elsewhere.[2] They might become superior to traditional magnets as far as applications involving light absorption are concerned. In fact, organic compounds are usually transparent in many spectral regions and could be in principle obtained in optically active chiral forms. Thus, they might be used as magneto-optical switches and for the manipulation of polarized light in optical devices. Organic materials are generally electric insulators, so they might lead to insulating magnets in contrast with most of the traditional magnets that are electric conductors. Plasticity, flexibility and solubility in common organic solvents are general characteristics of organic/polymeric compounds that confer them an easy processability. Therefore, organic/polymeric magnets are ideal candidates to obtain magnetically active thin films and colloidal dispersions with ferrofluid properties. Biocompatibility is another characteristic of organic compounds that permits to imagine biomedical applications like for instance the use of organic magnets for drug addressing and as selective contrasting agents in nuclear magnetic resonance imaging. Finally, the state-of-the-art of organic chemistry techniques permits nowadays to synthesize tailor-made compounds and, therefore, to perform small structural modifications in order to tune their physical properties. Such a tunability is unprecedented in most of traditional inorganic materials and, therefore, open a wide range of practical opportunities.},

Here, by means of DFT + U calculations at the molecular and solid state levels we provide a rationale for the different SCO behaviour of the BF4− and ClO4− salts of the parent complex; the former features Fe(ii) complexes with a regular coordination geometry and undergoes a spin transition, whereas the Fe(ii) complexes of the latter adopt a distorted structure and remain in the high-spin state at all temperatures. The different SCO behaviour of both salts can be explained on the basis of a combination of thermodynamic and kinetic effects. The shape of the SCO units at high temperature is thermodynamically controlled by the intermolecular interactions between the SCO units and counterions within the crystal. The spin trapping at low temperatures in the ClO4− salt, in turn, is traced back to a kinetic effect because our calculations have revealed the existence of a more stable polymorph having SCO units in their low-spin state that feature a regular structure. From the computational point of view, it is the first time that the U parameter is fine-tuned on the basis of CASPT2 calculations, thereby enabling an accurate description of the energetics of the spin transition at both molecular and solid-state levels.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}In many reaction-diffusion processes, ranging from biochemical networks, catalysis, to complex self-assembly, the spatial distribution of the reactants and the stochastic character of their interactions are crucial for the macroscopic behavior. The recently developed mesoscopic Green’s Function Reaction Dynamics (GFRD) method enables efficient simulation at the particle level provided the microscopic dynamics can be integrated out. Yet, many processes exhibit non-trivial microscopic dynamics that can qualitatively change the macroscopic behavior, calling for an atomistic, microscopic description. We propose a novel approach that combines GFRD for simulating the system at the mesoscopic scale where particles are far apart, with a microscopic technique such as Langevin dynamics or Molecular Dynamics (MD), for simulating the system at the microscopic scale where reactants are in close proximity. This scheme defines the regions where the particles are close together and simulated with high microscopic resolution and those where they are far apart and simulated with lower mesoscopic resolution, adaptively on the fly. The new multi-scale scheme, called MD-GFRD, is generic and can be used to efficiently simulate reaction-diffusion systems at the particle level.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Being an all-electron code, exciting allows the calculation of optical and core excitations on the same footing. The implementation fully includes the effects of finite momentum transfer which may occur in inelastic x-ray spectroscopy and electron energy-loss spectroscopy. Our implementation does not require the application of the Tamm–Dancoff approximation that is commonly employed in the determination of absorption spectra in condensed matter. The interface with parallel linear-algebra libraries enables the calculation for complex systems. The capability of our implementation to compute, analyze, and interpret the results of different spectroscopic techniques is demonstrated by selected examples of prototypical inorganic and organic semiconductors and insulators.},

A Padé approximant technique is used to accurately interpolate the recent Monte Carlo results (para and ferro) of Ceperley and Alder into the important range of densities for atoms, molecules, and metals. These results can be combined with the RPA spin-dependence so as to produce a correlation energy for a spin-polarized homogeneous electron gas with an estimated maximum error of 1 mRy and thus should reliably determine the magnitude of non-local corrections to the local spin density approximation in real systems.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Self-interaction errors (SIE) of these functionals were compared and analyzed in terms of contributions from valence and core orbitals. We also calculated enthalpies of formation of the standard G2-1 set of 55 molecules and found that self-interaction-correction (SIC) improves agreement with experiment only for the LSDA functional, while all other functionals show worse performance upon introducing SIC. This is the first systematic study of the effect of SIC on thermochemical properties. We found no direct connection between the magnitude of the SIE contained in a functional and its performance for thermochemistry. Approximate functionals with large self-interaction errors can accurately reproduce enthalpies of formation.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Magnetic anisotropy is the capability of a system in a triplet or higher spin state to store magnetic information. Although the source of the magnetic anisotropy is the zero-field splitting of the ground state of the system, there is a difference between these two quantities that has to be fully rationalized before one makes comparisons. This is especially important for small spins such as triplets, where the magnetic anisotropy energy is only half of the zero-field splitting. Density functional calculations of magnetic anisotropy energies correspond to a high-field limit where the spins are aligned by the external magnetic field. Data are presented for the well-studied molecular magnet Mn12O12 acetate. Both perturbative and self-consistent treatments, different quasirelativistic Hamiltonians (zeroth order regular approximation, Douglas–Kroll, effective core potentials) and exchange-correlation functionals are compared. It is shown that some effects usually considered minor, such as the inclusion of the exchange-correlation potential in the effective one-particle spin-orbit operator, lead to sizable differences when computing magnetic anisotropy energies. Higher-order contributions, that is, the difference between self-consistent and perturbative results, increase the magnetic anisotropy energy somewhat but do not introduce sizeable quartic terms or an in-plane anisotropy. In numerical experiments, on can switch off and on spin-orbit coupling at individual atomic sites. This procedure yields single-site contributions to the overall magnetic anisotropy energy that could be used as parameters in phenomenological spin Hamiltonians. If ferrimagnetic systems are treated with broken symmetry density functional methods where the Kohn–Sham reference function is not a spin eigenfunction, corrections are needed which depend on the size of the exchange couplings in the system and must therefore be evaluated case by case.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The X-ray spectra reveal the temperature-driven conversion between high-spin and low-spin states without any observable effect of the ferroelectric polarization on the spin state of the molecules down to 100 K. In the soft X-ray-induced excited spin-state trapping (SOXIESST) regime at 3 K, large differences occur between the two ferroelectric polarizations. The efficiency of X-rays in exciting the molecules to the high-spin state is more than an order of magnitude larger when the ferroelectric dipoles of the substrate are pointing toward the surface compared to the opposite polarization. We explain our findings by a modulation of the polarization-dependent efficiency of the scattering of X-ray-generated secondary electrons at the molecules.

Here, stable room‐temperature templating of individual molecules with localized electronic states on the surface of a locally reactive 2D material, silicene grown on ZrB $_{\textrm{2}}$ , is demonstrated. Using a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy and density functional theory, it is shown that the binding of iron phthalocyanine (FePc) molecules is mediated via the strong chemisorption of the central Fe atom to the sp $^{\textrm{3}}$ ‐like dangling bond of Si atoms in the linear silicene domain boundaries. Since the planar Pc ligand couples to the Fe atom mostly through the in‐plane d orbitals, localized electronic states resembling those of the free molecule can be resolved. Furthermore, rotation of the molecule is restrained because of charge rearrangement induced by the bonding. These results highlight how nanoscale changes can induce reactivity in 2D materials, which can provide unique surface interactions for enabling novel forms of guided molecular assembly. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Here we explore such an issue by modeling the spin transport of a single-walled carbon nanotube grafted with one nickelocene molecule. In particular we investigate how the electron transport becomes spin-polarized depending on the specific linking group bonding nickelocene to the nanotube. We consider as linkers both aziridine and pyrrolidine rings and the amide group. Our calculations show that, at variance with aziridine, both pyrrolidine and amide, do alter the sp2 character of the binding site of the nanotube and thus affect the transmission around the Fermi level. However, only aziridine allows transferring the spin polarization of the nickelocene to the nanotube, whose conductance at the Fermi level becomes spin-polarized. This suggests the superiority of aziridine as a linker for grafting magnetic molecules onto carbon nanotubes with efficient spin filtering functionality.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Our calculations show that the Ni adatom not only binds strongly to the sidewall of the nanotube, but also maintains the spin degeneracy and affects little the transmission around the Fermi level. When the Ni adatom further binds to a metallocene molecule, its density of states is modulated by that of the molecule and electron scattering takes place in the nanotube. In particular, we find that for both cobaltocene and nickelocene the transport across the nanotube becomes spin-polarized. This demonstrates that metallocene molecules and carbon nanotubes can become a promising materials platform for applications in molecular spintronics.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Two-dimensional molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is a promising material for the next generation of switchable transistors and photodetectors. In order to perform large-scale molecular simulations of the mechanical and thermal behavior of MoS2-based devices, an accurate interatomic potential is required. To this end, we have developed a Stillinger-Weber potential for monolayer MoS2. The potential parameters are optimized to reproduce the geometry (bond lengths and bond angles) of MoS2 in its equilibrium state and to match as closely as possible the forces acting on the atoms along a dynamical trajectory obtained from ab initio molecular dynamics. Verification calculations indicate that the new potential accurately predicts important material properties including the strain dependence of the cohesive energy, the elastic constants, and the linear thermal expansion coefficient. The uncertainty in the potential parameters is determined using a Fisher information theory analysis. It is found that the parameters are fully identified, and none are redundant. In addition, the Fisher information matrix provides uncertainty bounds for predictions of the potential for new properties. As an example, bounds on the average vibrational thickness of a MoS2 monolayer at finite temperature are computed and found to be consistent with the results from a molecular dynamics simulation. The new potential is available through the OpenKIM interatomic potential repository at https://openkim.org/cite/MO\_201919462778\_000.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Outlining difficulties with current density functionals and wave function-based approaches, we highlight why double hybrid density functionals represent promising candidates for this purpose. In turn, we show that PBE0-DH (and PBE-QIDH) offers a significant improvement over its hybrid parent functional PBE0 [as well as B3LYP* and coupled cluster singles and doubles with perturbative triples (CCSD(T))] when computing spin-state splitting energies, using high-level diffusion Monte Carlo calculations as a reference. We refer to the opposing influence of Hartree-Fock (HF) exchange and MP2, which permits higher levels of HF exchange and a concomitant reduction in electronic density error, as the reason for the improved performance of double-hybrid functionals relative to hybrid functionals. Additionally, using 16 transition metal (Fe and Co) complexes, we show that low-spin states are stabilised by increasing contributions from MP2 within the double hybrid formulation. Furthermore, this stabilisation effect is more prominent for high field strength ligands than low field strength ligands.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The applications of machine learning techniques to chemistry and materials science become more numerous by the day. The main challenge is to devise representations of atomic systems that are at the same time complete and concise, so as to reduce the number of reference calculations that are needed to predict the properties of different types of materials reliably. This has led to a proliferation of alternative ways to convert an atomic structure into an input for a machine-learning model. We introduce an abstract definition of chemical environments that is based on a smoothed atomic density, using a bra-ket notation to emphasize basis set independence and to highlight the connections with some popular choices of representations for describing atomic systems. The correlations between the spatial distribution of atoms and their chemical identities are computed as inner products between these feature kets, which can be given an explicit representation in terms of the expansion of the atom density on orthogonal basis functions, that is equivalent to the smooth overlap of atomic positions power spectrum, but also in real space, corresponding to n-body correlations of the atom density. This formalism lays the foundations for a more systematic tuning of the behavior of the representations, by introducing operators that represent the correlations between structure, composition, and the target properties. It provides a unifying picture of recent developments in the field and indicates a way forward toward more effective and computationally affordable machine-learning schemes for molecules and materials.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Van der Waals heterostructures based on the heteroassembly of 2D materials represent a recently developed class of materials with promising properties especially for optoelectronic applications. The alignment of electronic energy bands between consecutive layers of these heterostructures crucially determines their functionality. In the present paper, relying on dispersion-corrected density-functional theory calculations, we present electrostatic design as a promising tool for manipulating this band alignment. The latter is achieved by inserting a layer of aligned polar molecules between consecutive transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) sheets. As a consequence, collective electrostatic effects induce a shift of as much as 0.3ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂeV in the band edges of successive TMD layers. Building on that, the proposed approach can be used to design electronically more complex systems, like quantum cascades or quantum wells, or to change the type of band lineup between type II and type I.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Wide-band-gap GaN and Ga-rich InGaN alloys, with energy gaps covering the blue and near-ultraviolet parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, are one group of the dominant materials for solid state lighting and lasing technologies and consequently, have been studied very well. Much less effort has been devoted to InN and In-rich InGaN alloys. A major breakthrough in 2002, stemming from much improved quality of InN films grown using molecular beam epitaxy, resulted in the bandgap of InN being revised from 1.9 eV to a much narrower value of 0.64 eV. This finding triggered a worldwide research thrust into the area of narrow-band-gap group-III nitrides. The low value of the InN bandgap provides a basis for a consistent description of the electronic structure of InGaN and InAlN alloys with all compositions. It extends the fundamental bandgap of the group III-nitride alloy system over a wider spectral region, ranging from the near infrared at ∼1.9 μm (0.64 eV for InN) to the ultraviolet at ∼0.36 μm (3.4 eV for GaN) or 0.2 μm (6.2 eV for AlN). The continuous range of bandgap energies now spans the near infrared, raising the possibility of new applications for group-III nitrides. In this article we present a detailed review of the physical properties of InN and related group III-nitride semiconductors. The electronic structure, carrier dynamics, optical transitions, defect physics, doping disparity, surface effects, and phonon structure will be discussed in the context of the InN bandgap re-evaluation. We will then describe the progress, perspectives, and challenges in the developments of new electronic and optoelectronic devices based on InGaN alloys. Advances in characterization and understanding of InN and InGaN nanostructures will also be reviewed in comparison to their thin film counterparts.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Spin crossover in transition metal complexes can be studied in great detail with computational chemistry. Over the years, the understanding has grown that the relative stability of high-spin (HS) versus low-spin (LS) states is a subtle balance of many factors that all need to be taken into account for a reliable description. Among the different contributions, the zero-point energy (ZPE) and the entropy play key roles. These quantities are usually calculated assuming a harmonic oscillator model for the molecular vibrations. We investigated the impact of including anharmonic corrections on the ZPE and the entropy and indirectly on the critical temperature of spin crossover. As test systems, we used a set of ten Fe(II) complexes and one Fe(III) complex, covering different coordination modes (mono-, bi-, and tri-dentate ligands), decreasing coordination number upon spin crossover, coordination by second- and third-row atoms, and changes in the oxidation state. The results show that the anharmonicity has a measurable effect, but it is in general rather small, and tendencies are not easily recognized. As a conclusion, we put forward that for high precision results, one should be aware of the anharmonic effects, but as long as computational chemistry is still struggling with other larger factors like the influence of the environment and the accurate determination of the electronic energy difference between HS and LS, the anharmonicity of the vibrational modes is a minor concern.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Silicon photonics has offered a versatile platform for the recent development of integrated optomechanical circuits. However, silicon is limited to wavelengths above 1.1 μm and does not allow device operation in the visible spectrum range where low-noise lasers are conveniently available. The narrow bandgap of silicon also makes silicon optomechanical devices susceptible to strong two-photon absorption and free carrier absorption, which often introduce strong thermal effects that limit the devices' stability and cooling performance. Further, silicon also does not provide the desired lowest order optical nonlinearity for interfacing with other active electrical components on a chip. On the other hand, aluminum nitride (AlN) is a wide-band semiconductor widely used in micromechanical resonators due to its low mechanical loss and high electromechanical coupling strength. In this paper, we report the development of AlN-on-silicon platform for low loss, wide-band optical guiding, as well as its use for achieving simultaneously high-optical-quality-factor and high-mechanical-quality-factor optomechanical devices. Exploiting AlN's inherent second-order nonlinearity we further demonstrate electro-optic modulation and efficient second harmonic generation in AlN photonic circuits. Our results suggest that low-cost AlN-on-silicon photonic circuits are excellent substitutes for complementary metal-oxide–semiconductor-compatible photonic circuits for building new functional optomechanical devices that are free from carrier effects.},

The formal connection between electron transport and electron transfer is made, and they work out the simple case of an electronic level coupled to a vibrational mode representing a thermal bath and show that the result is the same as expected from a Fermi golden rule treatment, and in the high-temperature limit yields the Marcus electron transfer theory.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Based on first-principles calculations, we predict that the recently synthesized two-dimensional (2D) NbSe2 can be changed from the metallic to the semiconducting phase upon the adsorption of H with an indirect bandgap of 2.99 eV. The bandgap opening of the 2D NbSe2 only occurs when the hydrogen coverage is high, and it is sensitive to mechanical strain. The hydrogenated 2D NbSe2 is dynamically stable under a tensile strain of up to 9\%, whereas a compressive strain leads to instability of the system. The optical spectra obtained from the GW-Bethe–Salpeter equation calculations suggest that 2D NbSe2 is highly isotropic, and it will not affect the polarization of light along the x- or y-direction. The optical bandgap, describing the transition energy of the exciton, is sensitive to the mechanical strain with the calculated exciton binding energy of ∼0.42 eV. These intriguing properties suggest that H functionalized 2D NbSe2, grown on a substrate with a larger lattice parameter, can be used to modulate the bandgap of NbSe2. This is beneficial in developing a nanoscale field effect and optoelectronic devices.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We considered two different levels of vacancy concentration, i.e., θ=1/62 and θ=1/34. While the pristine GaN 2D structures are intrinsically semiconducting, the 2D GaN with VGa defects under tensile/compressive biaxial strains is metallic, except at a high compressive strain of 6\%. In addition, the 2D GaN exhibits a strain-tunable magnetic property by introducing the VGa defects, where the magnetic moment can be modulated by applying a biaxial strain on the material. A compressive strain larger than 2\% tends to suppress the magnetic effect. A drastic reduction of the total magnetization from 2.21 μB to 0.16 μB is clearly visible for a lower VGa concentration of θ=1/62. On the other hand, the 2D GaN with VN defects is nonmagnetic, and this behavior is not affected by the biaxial strain.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

For materials exhibiting spontaneous polarization, we show that the conventional scheme of passivation with pseudo hydrogen is unable to realize a charge-neutral surface. The presence of a net surface charge induces via Gauss’s law a macroscopic electric field through the slab and results in poor size convergence with respect to the thickness of the slab. We propose a modified passivation method that accounts for the effect of spontaneous polarization, describes the correct bulk limits and boosts convergence with respect to slab thickness.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is one of the most promising materials for many technological applications ranging from optics to electronics. In past years, a property-tunable strategy that involves the construction of electronic structures of h-BN through an atomic-level design of point defects has been in vogue. The point defects imported during material synthesis or functionalization by defect engineering can endow h-BN with new physical characteristics and applications. In this Perspective, we survey the current state of the art in multifunction variations induced by point defects for 2D h-BN. We begin with an introduction of the band structure and electronic property of the pristine h-BN. Subsequently, the formation and characterization of the most obvious point defects and their modulation in electronic structures of h-BN nanomaterials are envisaged in theory. The experimental results obtained by atom-resolved transmission electron microscopy, magnetic measurement, and optical measurements have provided insights into the point defect engineered structures and their corresponding emerging properties. Finally, we highlight the perspectives of h-BN nanomaterials for heterostructures and devices. This Perspective provides a landscape of the point defect physics involved to demonstrate the modulation of the structure and functionalities in h-BN and identify the roadmap for heterostructure and device applications, which will make advances in electronics, spintronics, and nanophotonics.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We find that electronic conduction in these systems is mediated by the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) of C60, as in the case of a single-C60-based device. However, as the positions of the LUMOs are pinned to the chemical potentials of their respective electrodes, their relative alignment shifts with applied bias and leads to a NDR at a very low bias. Furthermore, the position and magnitude of the NDR can be tuned by chemical modification of the C60 molecules.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}In this work, we apply many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) on large critical charge transfer (CT) complexes to assess its performance on the S1 excitation energy. Since the S1 energy of CT compounds is heavily dependent on the Hartree-Fock (HF) exchange fraction in the reference density functional, MBPT opens a new way for reliable prediction of CT S1 energy without explicit knowledge of suitable amount of HF-exchange, in contrary to the time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT), where depending on various functionals, large errors can arise. Thus, simply by starting from a (semi-)local reference functional and performing update of Kohn-Sham (KS) energies in the Green’s function G while keeping dynamical screened interaction (W(ω)) frozen to the mean-field level, we obtain impressingly highly accurate S1 energy at slightly higher computational cost in comparison to TD-DFT. However, this energy-only updating mechanism in G fails to work if the initial guess contains a fraction or 100\% HF-exchange, and hence considerably inaccurate S1 energy is predicted. Furthermore, eigenvalue updating both in G and W(ω) overshoots the S1 energy due to enhanced underscreening of W(ω), independent of the (hybrid-)DFT starting orbitals. A full energy-update on top of HF orbitals even further overestimates the S1 energy. An additional update of KS wave functions within the Quasi-Particle Self-Consistent GW (QSGW) deteriorates results, in stark contrast to the good results obtained from QSGW for periodic systems. For the sake of transferability, we further present data of small critical non-charge transfer systems, confirming the outcomes of the CT-systems.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} Layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are commonly classified as quasi-two-dimensional materials, meaning that their electronic structure closely resembles that of an individual layer, which results in resistivity anisotropies reaching thousands. Here, we show that this rule does not hold for 1T-TaS $_{\textrm{2}}$ —a compound with the richest phase diagram among TMDs. Although the onset of charge density wave order makes the in-plane conduction non-metallic, we reveal that the out-of-plane charge transport is metallic and the resistivity anisotropy is close to one. We support our findings with ab initio calculations predicting a pronounced quasi-one-dimensional character of the electronic structure. Consequently, we interpret the highly debated metal-insulator transition in 1T-TaS $_{\textrm{2}}$ as a quasi-one-dimensional instability, contrary to the long-standing Mott localisation picture. In a broader context, these findings are relevant for the newly born field of van der Waals heterostructures, where tuning interlayer interactions (e.g., by twist, strain, intercalation, etc.) leads to new emergent phenomena. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

That is incompatible with automated (work-flow-driven) screening. An acceptable methodology must be quantum mechanically sound, yield both basic structure and property values, and accurate ΔEHL without steering or tuning. Cost vs. accuracy causes focus on density functional theory (DFT). We show by a near-exhaustive study of schemes for calculating the basic molecular high-low spin energy difference, ΔEHL, that presently there is no combination of a constraint-based, non-empirical density functional approximation (DFA) and a set of well-defined semi-empirical corrections to it adequate for such a protocol. Somewhat successful hybrid DFA calculations of ΔEHL are too costly for high-throughput screening of condensed phases. Lower-cost alternatives combine a generalized gradient approximation (GGA) DFA with a Hubbard-U correction (DFT + U). But we show that neither U=0 nor any currently available unsteered U calculation gives a decent ΔEHL value for [Mn(taa)] without also degrading molecular structure or property predictions. Moving to the SCAN meta-GGA does not solve the problem. The revised-restored SCAN (r2SCAN) meta-GGA together with its deorbitalized version r2SCAN-L give improved but not wholly satisfactory results. We also document and diagnose several non-obvious technical and procedural sensitivities and inter-code differences. In addition to being a formidable challenge to DFA development, the lack we delineate is a major impediment to progress in the development of quantum materials and spintronics.},

The deposited FeIII spin-crossover compound is controllably switched between three different states, each of them exhibiting a characteristic tunneling conductance.

We have witnessed a jump in the phase memory times of spin qubits from a few microseconds to almost a millisecond in a vanadium complex, magnetic hysteresis up to 60 K in a dysprosium-based magnetic molecule and magnetic memory up to 30 K in a holmium atom deposited on a surface. With single-molecule magnets being more than two decades old, this rapid improvement in the physical properties is surprising and its explanation deserves urgent attention. The general assumption of focusing uniquely on the energy barrier is clearly insufficient to model magnetic relaxation. Other factors, such as vibrations that couple to spin states, need to be taken into account. In fact, this coupling is currently recognised to be the key factor that accounts for the slow relaxation of magnetisation at higher temperatures. Herein we will present a critical perspective of the recent advances in molecular nanomagnetism towards the goal of integrating spin–phonon interactions into the current computational methodologies of spin relaxation.

This is even more important for spin crossover (SCO) systems, in which the spin transition is extremely sensitive to size reduction effects. These bi-stable materials have great potential for the development of nanotechnological applications provided their intrinsic properties can be successfully implemented in nanometric films, amenable to the fabrication of functional nanodevices. Here we report the fabrication of crystalline ultrathin films ({\textless}1–43 nm) of two-dimensional Hofmann-type coordination polymers by using an improved layer-by-layer strategy and a close examination of their SCO properties at the nanoscale. X-ray absorption spectroscopy data in combination with extensive atomic force microscopy analysis reveal critical dependence of the SCO transition on the number of layers and the microstructure of the films. This originates from the formation of segregated nanocrystals in early stages of the growth process that coalesce into a continuous film with an increasing number of growth cycles for an overall behaviour reminiscent of the bulk. As a result, the completeness of the high spin/low spin transition is dramatically hindered for films of less than 15 layers revealing serious limitations to the ultimate thickness that might be representative of the performance of the bulk when processing SCO materials as ultrathin films. This unprecedented exploration of the particularities of the growth of SCO thin films at the nanoscale should encourage researchers to put a spotlight on these issues when contemplating their integration into devices.},

@phdthesis{latini_excitons_2016,
	title = {Excitons in van der {Waals} {Heterostructures}: {A} theoretical study},
	abstract = {Van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) represent a novel and largely unexplored class of materials. Since 2013, when Geim and Grigorieva first conceived the stacking of 2D (two-dimensional) materials to create artificial layered structures with tailored properties, a number of promising (opto)electronics devices, e.g. light emitting diodes, solar cells, ultra-fast photodetectors, transistors etc., have been successfully fabricated. It is well established that for isolated 2D semiconductors and vdWHs the optical response is governed by excitonic effects. While it is understood that the reduced amount of electronic screening in freestanding 2D materials is the main origin of extraordinarily strongly bound excitons, a theoretical understanding of excitonic effects and of how the electronic screening is affected for the more complex case of multi-layer structures is still lacking due to the computational limitations of standard ab-initio methods.In this thesis first-principles models that overcome the limitations of standard ab-initio techniques are developed for the description of dielectric, electronic and excitonic properties in isolated 2D materials and vdWHs. The main contribution is a multi-scale method that seemingly connects the excitonic effects in the monolayer limit to the more challenging case of multi-layered structures. The method is based on the analogy between vdWHs and the popular construction toy Lego. This analogy is much deeper than one would first expect: it is possible to predict the dielectric properties of a vdWH from the dielectric functions of the individual 2D layers, which represent the dielectric genome of the heterostructure. From the vdWH dielectric properties one evaluates the screened interaction between the electron and hole forming the exciton which can then be used in a generalized hydrogenic model to compute exciton binding energies in isolated, supported, or encapsulated 2D semiconductors. The non-locality of the dielectric screening is inherently included in our method and we can successfully describe the non-hydrogenic Rydberg series of low-dimensional systems. This multi-scale method also proves successful when combined with many-body perturbation techniques for accurate prediction of electronic band structure or with complex scaling techniques for exciton dissociation rates in vdWHs. The validity of our techniques is demonstrated through numerous comparison to experimental results.Ultimately this thesis puts forth a first-principles methodology that allows us to address scientific questions that are beyond the capability of existing state of the art techniques and enables 2D materials researcher to predict and design dielectric, electronic and excitonic properties of general vdWHs.},
